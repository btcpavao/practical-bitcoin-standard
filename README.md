# Introduction

Bitcoin is a very different kind of money than the fiat money we all use every day. Since 2009, Bitcoin's purchasing power has increased while that of fiat has decreased. But the changes in bitcoin's purchasing power were much more volatile along the way.&#x20;

Since I began studying Bitcoin seriously in late 2017, I've witnessed a price drop from $20,000 to low $3,000 per BTC, a retracement of almost 85 percent. Then I saw it go up all the way to almost $70,000, which is an increase of almost 2,300%. Then I saw it go down again to around $15,000, which is a retracement of around 80% from its high point. It was a wild ride, and I'm currently looking at the price, which is $26,672, a roughly 320% increase over the past five years.

Throughout this time, I've heard a variety of recommendations and approaches for addressing the bitcoin's volatility. Typical conservative advice was along the lines of "only buy bitcoin with money you will not need for at least couple of years" and "just buy small amount every month - dollar cost average."&#x20;

The aggressive approaches typically consisted of attempting to trade this volatility by purchasing bitcoin at low $ prices and selling it at high $ prices. I believe that both of these approaches can be effective for some (although they both carry risks), but there is a third approach that I rarely see, but am personally doing for the past three years very effectively.

This guide focuses on this third approach, which is to simply use bitcoin as your primary money. This basically means "going all in on bitcoin" and stop using fiat money as a hedge against the volatility of bitcoin's purchasing power.

It means converting all of your current and incoming money to bitcoin or making arrangements to be paid exclusively in bitcoin (if possible). You do this regardless of the current exchange rate. Then, when it's time to pay for your expenses, which are typically denominated in your local money, you exchange bitcoin back into fiat and pay (or, if possible, pay directly with bitcoin).

Today, you can use a variety of services and exchanges, such as a bitcoin debit cards, which convert bitcoin to fiat at the time of purchase and pay the merchant in fiat. If you don't have access to this, you can still use bitcoin as your primary money, but you'll need to plan your exchanges back to fiat money in advance. For instance, if you need to pay your rent in fiat next week, you can simply convert the amount you need to pay from bitcoin to fiat in advance.

But in order to do this safely and effectively, you must first learn, implement and consistently practice three money management principles: zero-based budgeting, debt-free living, and giving. These timeless principles are founded on millennia of wisdom, and are extremely important today, and even more so if you intend to use bitcoin as your primary money, because such a potent technology can have both extremely positive and extremely negative effects on your financial life.

Bitcoin today, in my opinion, is a technology comparable to electricity in its early years. Initially, most people were afraid of electricity because they did not know how to safely handle it. Most people today have heard of Bitcoin, but the vast majority of the population still does have any, and an even smaller proportion of those who do use Bitcoin as their primary money. This is mostly because they don't really know how to handle bitcoin's purchasing power volatility safely and effectively.

We also know that as people became accustomed to electricity, they learned how to handle it safely and effectively, and the technology spread. Today, we all teach young children not to approach electrical outlets while holding wet metal objects. We have installed overload and short circuit protection in our homes and buildings.

Today, a typical electricity user will not limit their electricity consumption to 1% of their power needs, as some Bitcoin investors do by allocating only 1% of their net worth to Bitcoin. Electricity users will not use electricity for only, say, two hours per month, as some Bitcoin users do today (they dollar-cost-average into Bitcoin with small money amounts).

Instead, an average electricity user will use as much electricity as he requires if he understands how electricity works and how to operate it safely and effectively. When you implement the timeless money management principles outlined in this guide, you will be able to use bitcoin as your primary money to its full potential. Instead of fearing the volatility of bitcoin's purchasing power, you will have safety mechanisms in place so that you can take full advantage of it.&#x20;

This guide has two sections.

The first section explains and discusses three fundamental principles of money management that you should implement and practice (as mentioned above, zero-based budgeting, debt-free living, and giving). These are required, true, and relevant today, just as they were thousands of years ago, when neither electricity nor bitcoin existed. They will continue to hold true despite technological advancements thousands of years in the future.

The second part discusses how to start using bitcoin as your primary money, assuming you have implemented the three fundamental money management principles, and how to think of it as a portion of your total net worth and its breakdown.
