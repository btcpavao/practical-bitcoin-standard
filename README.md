# Introduction

This is a guide on how to use bitcoin as your cash balance. It's about converting all of your income, regardless of currency it's paid in to bitcoin. It is also about paying for your regular daily transactions in fiat by converting bitcoin to fiat when needed.

If you are a bitcoiner who still has income in fiat, and you are considering doing something like this - this guide is for you. It's likely you are not sure what to do about bitcoin's purchasing power volatility. So the idea is to learn and adhere to timeless money management principles first, and only then upgrade to the full bitcoin standard.

Bitcoin is very different type of money than the one we are all used to. Bitcoin is increasing in purchasing over time, but it's doing so in a very unpredictable, volatile fashion. On the other hand, fiat is mostly losing purchasing power over time, but is doing so slowly and not apparently.

I like to think of bitcoin as a technological breakthrough similar to electricity. Electricity is very powerful and useful technology, but if not handled properly and safely, then it can be very dangerous and destructive. Bitcoin is a lot like that. You may have heard about cases of ruined financial lives due to mishandling bitcoin. When electricity was initially invented, most people were affraid of it because many didn't really know how to handle it safely. But over time, we got used to it and today we teach all teach small children not to approach electrical sockets with wet hands holding metal objects.

This guide explains the fundamental, timeless principles of handling any type of money. It is even more critical to understand these before attempting to upgrade to a full bitcoin standard.
