# Introduction

What is the motivation for writing this?

I felt there were no resources that adequately described how to use bitcoin as money in the most effective manner. I'm talking about using bitcoin as your cash balance, converting all of your earnings to it, and then converting it back to fiat for spending on a daily or weekly basis.

If you are considering this but are uncertain about how to proceed, this can serve as your guide to money management best practices and timeless principles. You are likely not doing this already because you are not sure what you'd do if bitcoin exchange rate drops significantly after you decide to do this, or how to handle bitcoin purchasing power volatility in general. So the idea is to learn and adhere to mentioned principles first, and then upgrading to the full bitcoin standard will have nothing but positive effects on your life.

Bitcoin is a different form of money than most people are used to. It is highly volatile deflationary money as opposed to fiat, which is inflationary money with (mostly, at least for major fiat currencies like USD or EUR) low volatility.&#x20;

This bitcoin characteristic generaly causes confusion, particularly for those who have not yet adopted wise money practices (zero-based budgeting, avoiding debt, and regularly giving).

I like to think of bitcoin as a technological breakthrough similar to electricity. Electricity is very powerful and useful technology, but if not handled properly and safely, then it can be very dangerous and destructive. Bitcoin is a lot like that. You may have heard about cases of ruined financial lives due to mishandling bitcoin. When electricity was initially invented, most people were affraid of it because many didn't really know how to handle it safely. But over time, we got used to it and today we teach all teach small children not to approach electrical sockets with wet hands holding metal objects.

This guide explains the fundamental, timeless principles of handling any type of money. It is even more critical to understand these before attempting to upgrade to a full bitcoin standard.
