# Introduction

* why write this book
  * I decided to write this because I felt there were no resources that fully explained how to use bitcoin as your money in the best way possible.&#x20;
  * Bitcoin is a very different type of money than most people are used to. It is highly volatile deflationary money as opposed to fiat, which is low volatility inflationary money. This fact alone causes a lot of confusion, especially for those who haven't yet mastered general good money practices (budgeting, debt-free living, and giving), which are especially important when you introduce bitcoin to your balance sheet.&#x20;
  * I like to think of bitcoin as a technological breakthrough similar to fire or electricity. These technologies are extremely powerful, but they can also be devastating if not handled correctly and safely. Bitcoin is a lot like that. There are people whose lives have been ruined financially because they mishandled bitcoin due to a lack of understanding of these fundamental principles.&#x20;
  * This guide is all about grasping the fundamental timeless money management principles that are a must for using bitcoin safely and constructively. People built civilizations once they figured out how to use fire and electricity.&#x20;
