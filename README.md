# Introduction

* why write this book
  * I decided to write this because I felt there was no resources that will comprehensively explain how to actually use bitcoin as your money in the best possible way. bitcoin is very different type of money than fiat that most people are used to. it is highly volatile deflationary money, compared to fiat that is low volatility inflationary money. and this fact alone creates alot of confusion, especially for those who haven't yet mastered general good practices with any form of money (budgeting, staying debt free and giving), and those are especially important when you introduce bitcoin to your balance sheet.
  * I like to compare bitcoin to technological breakthrough like fire or electricity. these technologies are immensely powerful, but as powerful they are, they can be devastating if not handled correctly and in a safe manner. bitcoin is very much like that. there are people whose life got financially ruined because they mishandled bitcoin due to not understanding these fundamental principles.
  * this guide is all about grokking essential timeless money management principles that are absolutely prerequisite of using bitcoin safely and constructively. people built civilization once they got a hold of how to handle fire, and electricity the same.&#x20;
