# Introduction

I'll assume that if you are reading this, you are already well-versed in Bitcoin and own at least some of it. I'll also assume you are aware of what sets Bitcoin apart from all the other cryptocurrencies that followed it. Finally, I'll assume you are aware of at least some of the issues the world is facing as a result of fiat money.

You might view your Bitcoin as a long-term investment, a piece of your retirement portfolio, or a "rainy day fund". I'm pretty sure though you are still not using it as your primary money. That is to say, you are probably still not earning it, or if you are earning fiat, you are probably not immediately converting all of your earnings to it. You probably aren't used to regularly converting bitcoin to fiat to pay for daily expenses either. And if you're well into your Bitcoin journey, you've probably considered it at least once, but you probably dismissed it due to bitcoin's high purchasing power volatility.

This manual will show you that using Bitcoin as your primary money is not only possible today, but might be the best way to use Bitcoin overall.

Let's talk about elephant in the room, Bitcoin and volatility.

Bitcoin is a very different kind of money from the fiat money we all use every day. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network in January 2009, its purchasing power has increased significantly while that of fiat has steadily declined.&#x20;

You've probably read about the well-known Bitcoin pizza transaction in which, in May 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz posted on the Bitcointalk.org forum that he wanted to purchase two Papa John's pizzas (costing about $30) for 10,000 BTC, and someone actually delivered them and got paid 10,000 BTC. At the time of writing (September 2023), 1 Bitcoin is worth about $27,000, therefore, 10,000 Bitcoins (or about $270 million) can buy about 18 million Papa John's pizzas. When you think about it, it's pretty amazing that Bitcoin's purchasing power increased nine million times in less than 14 years (going from 0.003$/BTC in 2010 all the way to $27,000/BTC in 2023).&#x20;

But this increase in purchasing power came with even more known volatility.

Since I began studying Bitcoin seriously in late 2017, I've witnessed a price drop from $20,000 to low $3,000 per BTC, a retracement of almost 85 percent. Then I saw it go up all the way to almost $70,000, which is an increase of almost 2,300%. Then I saw it go down again to around $15,000, which is a retracement of around 80% from its high point. It was a wild ride, and I'm currently looking at the price, which is $26,672, a roughly 320% increase over the past five years. However, when I consider my overall experience since my "get of zero" moment (in July 2014, at around $600/BTC), the current Bitcoin exchange rate is 44 times higher than my entry point, in just under 9 years.

I've heard a variety of recommendations and approaches for addressing Bitcoin volatility. Typical conservative advice was along the lines of "only buy bitcoin with money you will not need for at least couple of years" and "just buy small amount every month - dollar cost average."&#x20;

The aggressive approaches typically consisted of attempting to trade this volatility by purchasing bitcoin at low $ prices and selling it at high $ prices. I believe that both of these approaches can be effective for some (although they both carry risks), but there is a third approach that I rarely see, but am personally doing for the past three years very effectively.

This guide focuses on this third approach, which is to simply use bitcoin as your primary money. This basically means "going all in on bitcoin" and stop using fiat money as a hedge against Bitcoin volatility.

It means converting all of your current and incoming money to bitcoin or making arrangements to be paid exclusively in bitcoin (if possible). You do this regardless of the current exchange rate. Then, when it's time to pay for your expenses, which are typically denominated in your local money, you exchange bitcoin back into fiat and pay (or, if possible, pay directly with bitcoin).

Today, you can use a variety of services and exchanges, such as a bitcoin debit cards, which convert bitcoin to fiat at the time of purchase and pay the merchant in fiat. If you don't have access to this, you can still use bitcoin as your primary money, but you'll need to plan your exchanges back to fiat money in advance. For instance, if you need to pay your rent in fiat next week, you can simply convert the amount you need to pay from bitcoin to fiat in advance.

But in order to do this safely and effectively, you must first learn, implement and consistently practice three money management principles: zero-based budgeting, debt-free living, and giving. These timeless principles are founded on millennia of wisdom, and are extremely important today, and even more so if you intend to use bitcoin as your primary money, because such a potent technology can have both extremely positive and extremely negative effects on your financial life.

Bitcoin today, in my opinion, is a technology comparable to electricity in its early years. Initially, most people were afraid of electricity because they did not know how to safely handle it. Most people today have heard of Bitcoin, but the vast majority of the population still does have any, and an even smaller proportion of those who do use Bitcoin as their primary money. This is mostly because they don't really know how to handle bitcoin's purchasing power volatility safely and effectively.

We also know that as people became accustomed to electricity, they learned how to handle it safely and effectively, and the technology spread. Today, we all teach young children not to approach electrical outlets while holding wet metal objects. We have installed overload and short circuit protection in our homes and buildings.

Today, a typical electricity user will not limit their electricity consumption to 1% of their power needs, as some Bitcoin investors do by allocating only 1% of their net worth to Bitcoin. Electricity users will not use electricity for only, say, two hours per month, as some Bitcoin users do today (they dollar-cost-average into Bitcoin with small money amounts).

Instead, an average electricity user will use as much electricity as he requires if he understands how electricity works and how to operate it safely and effectively. When you implement the timeless money management principles outlined in this guide, you will be able to use bitcoin as your primary money to its full potential. Instead of fearing the volatility of bitcoin's purchasing power, you will have safety mechanisms in place so that you can take full advantage of it.&#x20;

This manual has two sections.

The first section explains and discusses three fundamental principles of money management that you should implement and practice (as mentioned above, zero-based budgeting, debt-free living, and giving). These are required, true, and relevant today, just as they were thousands of years ago, when neither electricity nor bitcoin existed. They will continue to hold true despite technological advancements thousands of years in the future.

The second section discusses how to start using bitcoin as your primary money, assuming you have implemented the three fundamental money management principles, and how to think of it as a portion of your total net worth and its breakdown.
