# The Big Purpose

If you recognize yourself in any of the following statements, this guide is for you:

* You know the difference between Bitcoin and _crypto_.
* You are Bitcoin-only.
* You have read The Bitcoin Standard.
* You practice dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin.
* You keep some fiat as dry-powder in case Bitcoin dumps so you can buy the dip.
* You attempted to grow your Bitcoin stack through trading, but [you'd rather buy and hold.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0)
* You have and use credit card(s).
* You have a personal loan.
* You use line of credit.
* There are moments when your checking account goes overdraft.
* You have a mortgage.
* You have an auto loan or lease.
* You have student loan debt.
* You have used or plan to use a home equity line of credit.&#x20;
* You are hesitant to spend your Bitcoin.
* You're (sort of) afraid to sell your Bitcoin in any significant amount.
* You believe there is a good debt and bad debt.
* If the opportunity presents itself, you'd probably take out a zero-interest loan and use it to buy more Bitcoin.
* You have a rough idea of how much you make and spend, but you don't have exact figures.
* You plan for retirement.
* You tried orange pilling your family and close friends, but they didn't take your advice as seriously as you would have liked.
* You are willing to allocate even more of your money to Bitcoin, but your partner/spouse is not really on the same page.
* You like to call your current work "fiat job", and don't have much of direct Bitcoin inflow streams.
* Because of Bitcoin's high volatility, you do not advise people to go all in.
* Sometimes you feel like you don't own enough Bitcoin.
* "Fiat is for spending, Bitcoin is for saving" sounds reasonable.

I'll assume that if you are reading this, you are already well-versed in Bitcoin and own it. I'll also assume you know what sets Bitcoin apart from "crypto" ([colloquially](https://youtu.be/vf1dym16poc?si=xryyftPxeWf8j1Q5), [shitcoins](https://coinmarketcrap.co/)) that followed it. Finally, I'll assume you are aware of at least some of the problems the world is facing as a result of [Fiat money](https://www.amazon.com/Fiat-Standard-Slavery-Alternative-Civilization/dp/1544526474).

You might view your Bitcoin as a long-term investment, a piece of your retirement portfolio, or a "rainy day fund." Depending on your journey with Bitcoin and when your "get off zero" moment occurred, you may have a Bitcoin position that is large or small relative to your total net worth.

I'm also assuming that you are still not using Bitcoin as your primary money. That is to say, your income is probably not all paid in Bitcoin, and you are likely not converting all your Fiat to Bitcoin immediately after the funds clear.

You're probably not used to converting Bitcoin to Fiat to pay for your expenses on a regular basis. If you've been following Bitcoin for a while, you've probably considered it, but dismissed it due to Bitcoin's high purchasing power volatility. You may have tried to trade some of your Bitcoin during the bull market, and you may have felt FOMO (fear of missing out) bullish sentiments, as well as the opposite, being a bit uneasy of how low Bitcoin price can fall in a bear market.&#x20;

You might have some credit obligations, such as a mortgage, car loan, a student loan or credit card balance. You don't want to be a "forced seller" of Bitcoin, so you're treading carefully when it comes to deciding how and when to invest in it. You think about Bitcoin as a "buy and hold" asset, instead of "exchange Fiat to Bitcoin money". And you kind of don't want to sell your Bitcoin because you know it's going up forever.

If you recognize yourself in any of this, this manual is for you.

I will show you that using Bitcoin as your primary money is not only possible today but is the best way to use Bitcoin overall. This basically means "going all in on Bitcoin" and stopping using Fiat money as a hedge against Bitcoin volatility, altogether. It also means converting all of your current money substitutes, like real estate, stocks & bonds portfolios into Bitcoin.

To do this right, though, you'll need to make sure you have a solid understanding of how to handle money in general. And I'm not talking about learning extremely complex and arcane financial knowledge. I'm talking about going back to the most basic rules about money that people have always known and following the best practices that have been passed down from generation to generation for thousands of years.

Let's talk about the elephant in the room: Bitcoin and it's high volatility.

Bitcoin is a very different kind of money from fiat we all use every day. Since the launch of the Bitcoin network in January 2009, its purchasing power has increased significantly while that of fiat has steadily declined.

You probably already know about the [famous Bitcoin pizza transaction](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0). In May 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz posted on the Bitcointalk.org forum wanting to purchase two pizzas (costing about $30) for 10,000 BTC, and someone actually delivered them for that price. At the time of writing this (November 2023), 1 bitcoin is worth about $35,000. So, 10,000 bitcoins, equivalent to about $350 million today, could buy around 12 million pizzas. It's pretty amazing that Bitcoin's purchasing power increased so significantly in less than 14 years.

But this increase in purchasing power came with even more well-known volatility.

When I consider my overall experience since my "get off zero" moment (in July 2014, at around $600/BTC), the current Bitcoin exchange rate is 44 times higher than my entry point, in just a bit over 9 years.

But I only began studying Bitcoin seriously in late 2017, because I completely forgot about my initial Bitcoin purchase in summer of 2014 until then. I've witnessed Bitcoin price running up all the way to the peak of $20,000 in December 2017, and then dropping down to as low as $3,300 per BTC in November 2018, a retracement of almost 85 percent. Then I witnessed Bitcoin recovering all the way to around $12,000 in summer of 2019, dropping back to around $8-9k range. And then March of 2020 came in, the infamous COVID crash, that slashed the price almost in half (though for a short period), touching $4k-$5k range.

And then I witnessed 2020 halving, and Bitcoin following up all the way to around $60k in Spring of 2021 (1200% increase), then drop back down to around $30k during the Summer of 2021 (50% decrease), only to climb back up to almost $70k in November of 2021. Then I saw it go down again in 2022, all the way down to previous cycle all time high of $20k in Summer of 2022, and retrace down even more to $15k-$16k in November of 2022, which is a retracement of around 80 percent from its high point. It was a wild ride, and I'm currently looking at the $26,672/BTC price in September of 2023, which is roughly 320 percent increase over the past five years I'm following it closely.

I've seen and heard a wide variety of recommendations and approaches for addressing this Bitcoin volatility. Typical conservative advice was along the lines of "only buy Bitcoin with money you will not need for at least a couple of years" and "just buy a small amount every month: dollar-cost average."&#x20;

The more aggressive approaches typically consisted of attempting to trade this volatility by purchasing Bitcoin at low prices and selling it at high prices. I believe that both of these approaches can be effective for some (although they both carry risks that are often overlooked), but there is a third approach that I rarely see but am personally doing for the past three years very effectively, which is to simply use Bitcoin as your primary money.

It means converting all of your current and incoming money to Bitcoin or making arrangements to be paid exclusively in Bitcoin (if possible). You do this regardless of the current exchange rate. Then, when it's time to pay for your expenses, which are typically denominated in your local Fiat, you exchange Bitcoin back into Fiat and pay (or, if possible, pay directly with Bitcoin).

Today, you can use a variety of services and exchanges, such as Bitcoin debit cards, which convert Bitcoin to Fiat at the time of purchase and pay the merchant in fiat. If you don't have access to this, you can still use Bitcoin as your primary money, but you'll need to plan your exchanges back to fiat money in advance. For instance, if you need to pay your rent in Fiat next week, you can simply convert the amount you need to pay from Bitcoin to Fiat couple of days in advance.

But in order to do this safely and effectively and embrace high Bitcoin volatility, you must first learn, implement, and consistently practice three money management principles: planning your money through zero-based budgeting practice, living debt-free, and consistently separating a part of your budget (10-20%) for giving. These timeless principles are founded on millennia of wisdom and are extremely important today, and even more so if you intend to use Bitcoin as your primary money because such a potent, but still largely misunderstood technology can have both extremely positive and extremely negative effects on your financial life. I'll go into details on why & how to practically implement each money management principle.

Bitcoin today, in my opinion, is comparable to electricity in its early years. Initially, most people were afraid of electricity because they did not know how to safely handle it. Most people today have at least heard of Bitcoin, but the vast majority still does not have any, and an even smaller proportion of those who do actually use Bitcoin as their primary money. This is mostly because they don't really know how to handle Bitcoin's purchasing power volatility safely and effectively.

We know that as people became accustomed to electricity, they learned proper ways to handle it safely and effectively, and so the technology spread all around the world. Today, we all teach young children not to approach electrical outlets while holding wet metal objects. We have installed overload and short-circuit protection in our homes and buildings. We are advised not to try and poke holes in our lithium-ion batteries, just to see what happens.

So today, a typical electricity user will not limit their electricity consumption to 1% of their power needs, as some Bitcoin investors do by allocating only 1% of their net worth to Bitcoin. Today's electricity users will not use electricity for only, say, two hours per month, as some Bitcoin users do today (they dollar-cost-average into Bitcoin with small amounts of money every month).

Instead, an average electricity user today will use as much electricity as they require because they understand how to operate electrical devices safely and effectively.&#x20;

When you implement the timeless money management principles outlined in this guide, you will be able to use Bitcoin as your primary money to its full potential, just like you use electricity. Instead of fearing Bitcoin's volatility, you will have safety mechanisms in place. Instead of hedging against it, you will fully embrace it.

Instead of trying to predict the future exchange rate of Bitcoin and positioning yourself accordingly, you will completely flip the framework: you will learn to respond to changes in the purchasing power of Bitcoin (exchange rate) after they occur by reconciling and rebalancing your budget.

Instead of the "consume now, pay later" approach of the Fiat standard, you will eliminate debt from your life completely and learn the Bitcoin standard way of "pay now, consume later."

Instead of worrying about how you are going to increase your income, you will learn to practice setting aside a portion of your budget for giving, which will increase your capacity to earn money in unimaginable ways.

This manual has two sections.

The first section explains and discusses three fundamental principles of money management that you should implement and practice (as mentioned above: planning your money, living debt-free, and consistently setting aside a portion of your budget for giving). These principles are required, true, and relevant today, just as they were thousands of years ago when neither electricity nor Bitcoin existed. They will continue to hold true despite technological advancements thousands of years in the future.

The second section discusses how to start using Bitcoin as your primary money, assuming you have implemented the three fundamental money management principles. I'm going to show you how to think about Bitcoin as your cash balance which you are going to be budgeting, and regularly  reconciling it's purchasing power and rebalacing your budget accordingly.&#x20;

I'll also show you how you can balance the composition of your net worth using the rule of thirds. You will want to have at least a third of your net worth in cash balance (primarily Bitcoin). You will then look at your non-Bitcoin assets and view them as either part of Land (this refers to all assets you use in your leisure time), or Capital (this refers to all assets you use in your labor time, or use them to generate income).

I'll demonstrate why it's important to maintain both your Land and Capital to no more than one third of your total net worth each.

I'll show you how to rebalance your net worth during Bitcoin's bull and bear markets to ensure it's sustained growth.

You will also learn how to think about non-Bitcoin assets ownership and why & how to calculate the cost of ownership across time. This will enable you to decide wisely whether to buy or rent the asset.

If you've never heard of these concepts before, there is a lot to learn.&#x20;
