# Introduction

* why write this book
  * I decided to write this because I felt there were no resources that fully explained how to use bitcoin as your money in the best way possible.&#x20;
  * Bitcoin is a very different type of money than most people are used to. It is highly volatile deflationary money as opposed to fiat, which is low volatility inflationary money. This fact alone causes a lot of confusion, especially for those who haven't yet mastered general good money practices (budgeting, debt-free living, and giving), which are especially important when you introduce bitcoin to your balance sheet.&#x20;
  * I like to think of bitcoin as a technological breakthrough similar to fire or electricity. These technologies are extremely powerful, but they can also be devastating if not handled correctly and safely. Bitcoin is a lot like that. There are people whose lives have been ruined financially because they mishandled bitcoin due to a lack of understanding of these fundamental principles.&#x20;
  * This guide is all about grasping the fundamental timeless money management principles that are a must for using bitcoin safely and constructively. People built civilizations once they figured out how to use fire and electricity.&#x20;
* my bitcoin story
  * first heard about it in 2013, but didn't get to buy any due to Mt. Gox being too cumbersome
  * first get of zero moment in July 2014, but only $20 worth
  * forgot about it until late 2017 when I saw raging bull market and BTC crossing $16k, and I remember I bought it at $600
  * luckily I got very little time to get to exposed to shitcoins - and starting in 2018 I entered bear market
  * this was a year I also parted ways with my previous startup I co-founded and started learning about bitcoin. by the end of 2018 I got rid of shitcoins and went bitcoin only
* my budgeting story
  * I was apprehensive about running budget before early 2018. this is when I was approaching the end of my startup engagement, and stopped having regular inflows coming in. I started listening to Dave Ramsey show and heard hundreds of stories on how people got ruined by getting into debt. I also remembered my startup & personal experience with debt. I started zero-based budgeting in late 2017, but in 2018 I really honed into it
