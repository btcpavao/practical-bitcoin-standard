# Introduction

Bitcoin is a very different kind of money than the fiat money we all use every day. Since 2009, Bitcoin's purchasing power has increased while that of fiat has decreased. But the changes in bitcoin's purchasing power were much more volatile along the way.&#x20;

Since I began studying Bitcoin seriously in late 2017, I've witnessed a price drop from $20,000/btc to low $3,000/btc, a retracement of almost 85 percent. Then I saw it go up all the way to almost $70,000/btc, which is an increase of almost 2,300%. Then I saw it go down again to around $15,000/btc, which is a retracement of around 80% from its high point. It was a wild ride, and I'm currently looking at the price, which is $26,672/btc, a roughly 320% increase over the past five years.

Throughout this time, I've witnessed a variety of advice and approaches people have taken for tackling the matter. Conservative Bitcoin investment advice was usually along the lines of "only invest money you won't need for a couple of years" and "dollar cost average". The aggressive approaches typically consisted of attempting to trade this volatility by purchasing bitcoin at low prices and selling it at high prices.

This guide focuses on using bitcoin as a primary money. This involves converting all of your current and new money to bitcoin. Then, when it comes time to pay your expenses, you convert bitcoin back to fiat and pay them in the currency they are denominated in (which is typically your local fiat currency).

The money management principles outlined here are timeless and based on millennia of wisdom. If you are considering moving onto the full bitcoin standard, adhering to these principles will be even more important, because bitcoin is extremely powerful technology, and as such it can have powerful positive, but also very negative consequences on your financial life.&#x20;

Bitcoin in 2023, in my opinion, is a technology comparable to electricity in its early years. Initially, most people were afraid of electricity because they did not know how to safely handle it. Most people today have heard of Bitcoin, but the vast majority of the population still does have any, and an even smaller proportion of those who do use Bitcoin as their primary money. This is mostly because they don't really know how to handle bitcoin's purchasing power volatility safely and effectively.

We also know that as people became accustomed to electricity, they learned how to handle it safely and effectively, and the technology spread. Today, we all teach young children not to approach electrical outlets while holding wet metal objects. We have installed overload and short circuit protection in our homes and buildings.

Today, a typical electricity user will not limit their electricity consumption to 1% of their power needs, as some Bitcoin investors do by allocating only 1% of their net worth to Bitcoin. Electricity users will not use electricity for only, say, two hours per month, as some Bitcoin users do today (they dollar-cost-average into Bitcoin with small money amounts).

Instead, an average electricity user will use as much electricity as he requires if he understands how electricity works and how to operate it safely and effectively. When you implement the timeless money management principles outlined in this guide, you will be able to use bitcoin as your primary money to its full potential. Instead of fearing the volatility of bitcoin's purchasing power, you will have safety mechanisms in place so that you can take full advantage of it.&#x20;

This guide has two sections.

The first section explains and discusses three fundamental areas of money management that you should implement and practice. These are required, true, and relevant today, just as they were thousands of years ago, when neither electricity nor bitcoin existed. They will continue to hold true despite technological advancements thousands of years in the future.

The second part discusses how to start using bitcoin as your primary money, assuming you have implemented the three fundamental money management principles, and how to think of it as a portion of your total net worth and its breakdown.
