# Set Aside And Keep 10-20% Of Your Money For Giving

The third step is to create a budget category for giving and ensure that 10% to 20% of our money is always set aside for it. The main goal of this step is to consistently increase our inflows. By making transactions from Giving category, we'll grow our spirit of generosity. Our happiness is directly proportional to the strength of our generosity spirit. The happier we are, the better we will be at providing value to others. And the more value we can provide to others, the greater our earning capacity.

### Giver Gets More Benefit From Giving Than The Recipient

We should set aside 10% to 20% of our budget for the Giving category. We should also keep this portion of our budget assigned to the Giving category at all times. So when we spend from it, we recalculate 10% to 20% of what is left in our total budget and move money from other categories to Giving in order to adjust it back. When we spend money from other categories, we recalculate 10% to 20% of what is left in our total budget and adjust the amount in the Giving category.

We should do this primarily for the benefit of cultivating our spirit of generosity. And the spirit of generosity will increase our capacity to generate higher inflows.

We should always continue this practice as our inflows and net worth grow. If we do this correctly, our giving transactions will increase in size and frequency, further cultivating a spirit of generosity and increasing our capacity to generate even higher inflows. We should never stop doing this. Instead, we should think of it as becoming a habit.

### Giving Cultivates Spirit Of Generosity

You grow the spirit of generosity each and every time you make a financial transaction without expecting anything in return (defined as a giving transaction, that is, a transaction that deducted money from your budget's Giving category).

Consider it like watering a seed; as you continue to water it, it will eventually grow larger.

Most of the time, people immediately feel the effect of stimulating the growth of spirit of generosity. It's an incredibly uplifting feeling that can brighten your day on its own.

Not only that, but the emotion sort of lingers even after the transaction has been completed and some time has passed. Every new giving transaction you complete sort of builds upon the one before, creating a cumulative effect.

You become more and more immersed in this spirit as time goes on. It is similar to an aura, radiates outwards more and more, and has no cap on how large it can get.

Being generous also has the effect of granting you a sort of "permission" to enjoy spending your money on yourself. Most often, even if their budget allows for it and they want it, people who don't practice giving will feel guilty if they want to buy something for themselves that they deem "too expensive" or just "too much." This is true even if their budget allows for it and they want it. Giving transactions as a regular practice can help to reduce this subconcious sense of guilt.

Make a giving transaction in advance of any potentially stressful professional situation you may be in (such as a job interview, a difficult client negotiation you might anticipate, or the hiring or firing of an employee). Any communication benefits from having at least one party with a spirit of generosity.

### Giving Increases Risk Tolerance

In our professional lives, we will constantly come across opportunities to take risks with favorable rewards.

In other words, we have many opportunities with a favorable risk/reward ratio.

When we regularly practice giving, we naturally increase our overall risk tolerance and are able to take on higher risks with higher rewards.

This is because we are already accustomed to spending money without expecting anything in return, other than our spirit of generosity growing.

So, in this context, even if we make an investment with a favorable risk/return ratio but do not make the return, we are still benefiting and are not subject to the sunk cost fallacy.

### Giving Increases Capacity For Generating Inflows

If you earned your money through a voluntary, consensual exchange with another person, that person (your employer, client, or customer) valued the good or service you provided more than the money he paid you for it. As a result, the act of earning money is valuable in and of itself, and you are already acting morally when you are earning money. Voluntary exchange generates value for both parties.

"Giving back to society" is one of the worst phrases you will ever hear. If you pause and think about it, the phrase "giving back to society" implies that by earning money, you somehow took it away from society (thus, you are now giving it back). The right approach is to say that by earning your money, you already generated value for society, and by giving to charity, you want to improve your ability to earn money, which means you will be bringing even more value to society.

Giving money will make you more capable and better at earning money, because it will make you better at serving your customers. Your customers will like you more if you have a generous spirit because you'll be a more enjoyable person to be around. They will be more inclined to provide you with honest feedback on your goods or services, which will have a positive ripple effect on all your business operations down the line.

Also, you won't spend as much time worrying about insignificant problems that can occur in any business. When you make a mistake in business, such as choosing the incorrect partner or running into a "bad" customer who is dissatisfied with your offering and requests a refund, you will be able to quickly move on from them, learn your lesson, but do so in a way that doesn't use up any of your creative ability. This is due to the fact that you can always consider this expense to be a part of your overall giving. This frees you up to focus on what matters, which is figuring out how to serve your customers more effectively.

Generous people generally have better moods and a brighter, happier outlook on life. We all enjoy being around them because we don't feel they expect anything from us. They are simply allowing us to benefit from their state of being without taking anything away from them. It's like sunshine: if I enjoy it, it doesn't take away from someone else's enjoyment of it.

A generous person will always approach business negotiations from a win-win rather than a win-lose perspective. The negotiating party will always pick up on this and adopt it as well. And for a generous person, when they ocassionaly realize the counterparty is trying hard to negotiate down, they may still accept the deal to make the other person happy they won the negotiation. A generous person will always default to a long-term perspective: even if I don't make money on this particular deal - this negotiation is a win for me because it increased my generosity.

This also has tremendous business power.

### Be Grateful For The Opportunity To Give

Our spirit of generosity is increased each time we make a transaction from our Giving category.

We should always keep in mind that this action may or may not result in a benefit for the recipient. But always and without fail, we will generate benefit for our spiritual blueprint, leading to a growth in spirit of generosity.

As a result, we are not even looking for a "thank you" from the recipient, let alone seeking anything in return. In fact, we should be grateful that we had the opportunity to practice this act of giving.

Every time we make a transaction from the Giving category, our generosity will continue to grow, and if we remain thankful for the chance to do so, we'll feel more satisfied with our net worth and generally more optimistic about the future.

### Giving Increases Happiness

There will always be those who have more than we do, and those who have less.

We can compare our circumstances to those of others who are in a better position than us, which will make us feel inadequate and envious and lower our general level of happiness.

Alternatively, we can practice giving, which will always make us feel as though we have more than we need and will make us happier all around.

The feeling of having and producing value that other people can benefit from is what makes us happy when we practice giving. When we give, we feel like we have something valuable to offer others, which makes us happy.

We have a deep understanding that everyone benefits from our agency in the world. We can enjoy the things we give to ourselves more when we know that we can give to others and make them happy. We can enjoy the things we give to ourselves more when we understand that we can give to others and make them happy. We begin to fully grasp the interdependence of all humans and develop a profound appreciation for one another.

## What Is Considered Giving?

Giving is any action you do without expecting anything in return.

When you give, you should do so without expecting anything in return. Your giving should not result in a liability on the beneficiary's balance sheet. So don't keep track of transactions from the giving category as your assets.

If the recipient of your generosity later wishes to repay it, accept it only if they insist, and make it clear that you do not expect anything in return.&#x20;

Here are some of the ways you can give: direct financial assistance, charity, gifts, tips, loans without expectation of payback, investments without expectation of return, donations, sponsorships with no contractual obligations for promotional benefits.

## How To Give?

Giving smaller amounts more frequently is preferable to larger amounts less frequently.

Never go a year without making a single transaction from the Giving category.

Family comes first, then friends, then acquaintances, then the local community, and so on. The closer people are to your circle, the higher the priority.

If the giving is for charity, the best way is for the beneficiary to be unaware that you are a benefactor. You must always consider the dignity of the benefactor. Always keep the dignity of the benefactor in mind.

If the above is not possible (because the beneficiary will know who you are), the second best option is to give as an investment in their business (with no expectation of a return on your end).

Third, offer a no-interest loan with no expected return date (and no expectations of return on your end).

The third option is to provide a loan with no interest and no projected return date, along with no expectations of return from you.

This is a lifelong journey that you should continue and get better and wiser about over time; there is no end point to this practice.

## Giving In Your Budget

I recommend naming one category in your budget "Giving" and keeping it at 10% to 20% of your current budgeting amount (cash balance).

For example, if you have $10,000 in cash, you should allocate $1,000 to $2,000 to the Giving category.

When you spend from your Giving category, for example, if you buy a $100 gift, you should subtract that from your Giving category, which means it will be $900 or $1,900.

However, when you make transactions from other categories, you should rebalance the amount you assign to Giving, because Giving should always be 10% to 20% of your cash balance.

So, if you pay your rent and utilities for the month (say, $600) after purchasing the gift, your total cash balance drops from $10,000 to $9,300 ($100 from Giving and $600 from Shelter). This means that your new Giving category target should be 10% to 20% of $9,300, or between $930 and $1,860.

You will notice that by calculating your Giving category in this manner, you cannot completely deplete it unless you spend all of your money at the same time. This is deliberate, because your giving budget must always be available to you and must adjust in accordance with your current cash balance.

For example, say I start with $10,000 in money (Bitcoin) and allocate $2000 to giving. If Bitcoin falls 50% in purchasing power, and I do not let my $2000 in giving decrease, I'd have $3000 left in the rest of the budget. That means my giving would account for 40% of total budget, which is too much.

But to make it more interesting, say my total net worth may still be around $200k because I may own a $195k house (so $195k in house and $5k in money -> Bitcoin). But in this case, regardless of me keeping 40% of my budget in Giving category, when I make transactions from it, they won’t really affect the growth of the spirit of generosity because my giving budget is still only 1/100th of my total net worth and should be at least 1/60th.

At the end of the day, I believe that money is ultimately not mine; rather, it belongs to God. I only manage and steward it. To properly manage it, I must approach it with balance, keeping at least a third of my net worth in money and a tenth to a fifth of money in Giving at all times.

So in the example above, the proper course of action for me would be to sell $195k house, and then allocate between $20k and $40k to giving in my budget. If I wanted to buy and own a house I’d live in, I could only buy something up to $66k in price (1/3rd of $200k net worth). Then, I’d be left with $134k in money, so my giving budget would be between $13,4k and $26,8k. If I wanted to buy some capital assets, I’d buy up to $66k worth of it, which would leave me with $68k in money. In that case, I would have between $6,8k and $13,6k in giving.

In this situation, if I wanted to increase my inflows, I'd be more inclined to rent rather than own, simply to keep more of my net worth in money (Bitcoin) so I can have a larger giving budget and grow my spirit of generosity at a faster rate.

I also believe that a person can only do this properly once he is debt-free. I think a Bible quote “Borrower is a slave to the lender” is true divine wisdom. Therefore, I do not believe it is possible to cultivate a spirit of generosity while in debt. For this reason, I advise paying off debt prior to beginning giving practice. Giving money while in debt can result in resentment toward the lender. It will also slow down one's debt repayment. And the longer one is in debt, the stronger the spirit of slavery, confusion, and restlessness grows, causing a slew of other negative consequences.

So to add to the example above, let's say I had the same net worth, $200k, but this time I also had debt. For example, I owned a $395k house, had $5k in money (Bitcoin), and owed $200k on my mortgage. This $200k debt would have a wide range of negative effects. So I'd start by selling the $395k house, paying off the $200k in debt, and then proceeding as described above. If I decided to pay back that debt over time (which I wouldn't recommend for the reason that negative spirits caused by the state of debt grow with time one stays in the state of debt), then I'd remove giving category from the budget, and do either debt snowball or debt avalanche strategy.

## Keep At Least A Third Of Your Net Worth In Liquid Budget For Giving

If your giving budget is less than 1/60 of your total net worth, it will have no effect on the growth of your spirit of generosity.

On a gold standard, keeping a large amount of liquidity in gold meant paying a high cost for storage, security, insurance, and transfer.

On a fiat standard, having a lot of fiat cash on hand (either physical notes or digitally in bank accounts) means that your purchasing power will go down over time as the fiat money supply rises.

Giving transactions have no effect on the growth of the spirit of generosity if your giving budget falls below 1.7% of your total net worth.

Giving budgets ranging from 1.7% to 3.3% of total net worth will have a reduced impact on the growth of the spirit of generosity.

Giving budgets exceeding 6.7% of total net worth will have a progressively stronger effect on the growth of the spirit of generosity.

You need a lot of liquidity in your net worth to avoid feeling like your giving transactions are too difficult.

To put it another way, hold onto at least one-third of your net worth in cash (we'll go over how to use Bitcoin as your primary money and cash balance later).

This is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity to carry out giving transactions without hesitation.
