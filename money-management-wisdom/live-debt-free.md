# Live Debt-Free

This is the second step we should take: becoming and remaining debt-free. The main goal is to eliminate wasteful outflows.

## Your Money Exists In The Past And In The Future

### Never Spend Your Future Money

Why is it never a good idea to use credit or get into debt? Fundamentally, because the future is uncertain.

Let's think more deeply about it. What does it mean that the future is uncertain? This simply means that we do not know what will happen in our lives tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, or in ten years. We can plan for and expect some events to happen, but there is no way to know with certainty.

When one considers uncertainty about the future, they typically associate it with fear of negative outcomes. However, an uncertain future also implies the possibility of positive outcomes. We simply don't know what will happen, when, or how (both good and bad).

This is why it is fundamentally unwise to spend your future money. Simply said, you have no knowledge how much money you will earn or have in the future.

On the other hand, we know for certain what will happen if you spend from the future. Until you pay off the debt, your present cash outflows will increase.

This increase in your present cash outflows can be a problem in two different ways.

A negative event that might happen in the future (which, once again, you are unaware of) such as losing your job or seeing a decline in your cash inflows as a result of any unfavorable circumstance (losing the job, your clients filing for bankruptcy, getting sick, etc.). A reduction in income will make your debt situation worse since you run a higher risk of defaulting on your debt, which typically has a domino effect of negative consequences. Did you know that financial issues, primarily stemming from debt, account for the majority of divorces?

You might eventually come across a good opportunity that you regretfully miss out on because you are unable to take calculated risks with your income. For example, you may come across an opportunity to switch careers or start a new business. Both of these things could reduce or stop your income for a while (let's say for a year or two), but after this decrease, your income could double, triple, or grow by orders of magnitude more than what you make now. However, you are incurring this opportunity cost because you simply cannot afford to take the risk - because your cash outflows are already determined by the payments you must make.

Furthermore, each time you conduct a transaction, you are performing valuation in the here and now, and that valuation may alter later on. The item you are purchasing now may be more valuable to you than the money you must exchange to obtain it, whereas the same item may be less valuable to you than the money you must exchange for it in the future. Your subjective valuation can and will change due to a variety of factors, none of which you can predict with certainty.

### Always Spend Your Past Money

Spending money you already have means you are fully aware of its opportunity cost (because your money is already budgeted).

You will always receive a better deal when paying with cash for whatever you are purchasing than when using credit, and you will avoid paying the interest rate over time. When you add up these two, you should consider their future purchasing power if you were to save them in Bitcoin.

For instance, if you see something with a $5,000 manufacturerâ€™s suggested retail price (MSRP, or sticker price) and decide to buy it with cash, you may be able to negotiate the price down to around $4,500. If, on the other hand, you were to finance it over, say, five years, you would pay about $6,000 total, or $100 a month. But the $1,500 price difference should be adjusted for it's opportunity cost if it were saved in Bitcoin over 5 years. We are still talking about an annual compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 15%, even if we assume that Bitcoin will continue to grow at a rate ten times slower than its historical trend.

And this is without even considering the value of your potential to increase your inflows as a result of not growing a spirit of slavery, restlessness, and confusion, but rather a spirit of freedom, peace, and clarity over the time you'd otherwise be in debt.

## Being In Debt Is A State Measured In Two Dimensions: Time And Depth

When you are in debt, there are two factors that determine the level of slavery your spirit will develop. The first and most significant factor is the length of time spent in debt. This period is measured from the moment that you incurred debt to the moment you became debt-free. For instance, you could be in debt for seven days, seven months, or seven years. The longer one remains in debt, the deeper the spirit of slavery becomes rooted.

The second dimension of debt is the depth of your debt, which is the ratio between the value of your assets and liabilities. If you have $100,000 in assets and $80,000 in debt, you are 80% in debt. If your liabilities exceed the value of your assets, such as if you have $100,000 in assets but $150,000 in debt, you have negative net worth.

It is essentially impossible to completely avoid incurring debt because, even without entering into a formal debt contract with a lender, you generate liabilities during normal financial transactions. For instance, when you visit a restaurant, you typically consume the meal first and pay afterward. If you begin your meal at 7 p.m., finish it at 9 p.m., and then wait one hour to pay the bill, you are responsible for paying for one hour. It is preferable to pay when you finish your dinner at 9 p.m. and settle the bill immediately.

Likewise, when your regular bills arrive, get into a habit of paying them off immediately, rather than waiting to do it. Let's say you receive the bill for last month's electricity usage on the first of the following month, with a due date of the 15th. Do not delay making the payment until the 15th; instead, make the payment immediately on the 1st. Always return to the first principle stated above: the time spent in debt breeds the spirit of slavery. Eventually, you will not want to delay paying off your debts for any longer than absolutely necessary.

### Age Your Money

The older your money, the more financial peace you have. Debt reduces the age of money. Higher age of money equals lower time preference. A higher age of money allows for more time to research the purchase, resulting in a better purchase. With a higher age of money, you will enjoy your purchases more because there was more time spent planning, anticipating, and overall appreciation.

### Two States Of Being (In Debt And Debt-Free) Generate 6 Different Spirits

Spending credit taints a person's psychospiritual makeup with the spirits of slavery, restlesness and confusion.&#x20;

You can be either "In Debt" or "Debt Free" in your spiritual makeup. They both cultivate the growth of different spirits: when you are in debt, you cultivate the spirit of slavery, restlesness and confusion, and when you are debt-free, you cultivate the spirit of freedom, peace and clarity.

There is no such thing as "good" or "bad" debt, but there is a specific psychospiritual mechanism that one state cultivates over the other. It may be helpful to imagine your soul as a soil, with seeds of various spirits inside that are kind of laying there, dormant. When a seed is watered (in this metaphor, watering the seed is analogous to a specific practice), it sprouts and begins to grow.

If you keep watering it, it will get bigger, stronger, grow roots and a trunk, and eventually produce fruit.

When you owe money (i.e. have a liability on your balance sheet), you begin to "water" the seed of the spirit of slavery, restlesness and confusion.

When you have no liabilities, that is, you owe no money to anyone, you begin to "water" the spirit of freedom, peace and clarity.

## In Debt Spirits

### Spirit Of Slavery

Spiritually, the borrower is a slave of the lender. Slavery here is defined as not having freedom on deciding how to utilize time. There is the extent to which this freedom is reduced, and it's measured in the amount of time you will need to allocate for servicing the debt for the duration of the debt.&#x20;

People can intuitively sense this spirit in you by watching how you spend your money, do your job, and spend your free time. In general, the longer and more deeply in debt you are, the less free time you will have, the more stressful working life will be, and the more tightly you will have to restrict your spending.

Spirit of slavery gives off a subtle energy of desperation that other people can sense. This aura will keep inflow opportunities away. No one likes to deal with the desperate because it makes them feel bad if they do nothing to help. An answer for this is to make giving a regular habit.

When a person lacks a well-established giving practice and senses desperation emanating from the spirit of slavery in another person, they will seek to avoid or minimize economic interaction with that person.

The spirit of slavery means you can't fully control how you spend your time. Your time will be partially or fully used to service the debt.

The spirit of slavery gets stronger the longer you're in debt. Once you eliminate debt, it stops growing. The longer you stay out of debt, the slower it'll grow back if you decide to get into debt again.

Imagine it as an obstacle that arises when you lose the spirit of freedom. Rather than being surrounded by fruitful trees, it filled your environment with thorns and weeds. The presence of the spirit of slavery intensifies every challenge you encounter. The spirit of slavery consumes your sense of pleasure and intensifies your hardships.

Can you decide to dedicate the next six months of your life to a business venture that has an 80% chance of doubling your income in just one year? If you're already in debt for over a year and still have over 6 months of payments to go, then it's not happening.

Because of this, the spirit of slavery brings about opportunity cost on both your future inflows and your past inflows during your time in debt. Once you attain a debt-free state, the opportunity cost vanishes, leading to higher inflows and lower outflows over time as the spirit of freedom grows.

Once you are debt-free for at least one year, you can dedicate the following six months to a business venture with an 80% chance of doubling your income in a year.

Even if the inflow doesn't double (20% chance), you can repeat the process with the same time frames and odds. This time, since you'll have been out of debt for two years, you'll be able to plan your decisions for up to two years.

### Spirit Of Restlesness

Being in a state of debt means constantly worrying about making the next payment on time. This produces the spirit of restlessness.

The stability of your income source is crucial because debt repayment is your top priority. If your source of income encounters financial difficulties, it will directly affect you. Regardless of your conscious awareness, this will fuel your restlessness.

Your spirit of restlessness affects those around you.

Restlessness leads to impatience.

It disturbs sleep and negatively affects health.

It lowers the overall ability to earn money.

### Spirit Of Confusion

The main cause of the spirit of confusion is your choice to spend money from the uncertain future.

Humans can only make valuations in the present, and they can be informed by the certainty of their previous valuations.

When you spend from the future, you get confused about the value of what you bought. This is because you performed present valuation on the present thing you bought, but did so with future money. But in the future, your valuation can change completely.

Confusion raises the cost of ownership of the item you purchased because you are less likely to properly care for it. You are not properly caring for it because it is not truly yours until you pay it off.

Nevertheless, your valuation of the thing may change during the payoff period, and you may value the money you are paying for it more than the thing itself.

However, if you try to liquidate the thing and pay off the debt, you may find that the depreciation of the thing, combined with your reduced ongoing maintenance costs, increased the cost of ownership so much that you are unable to pay off the debt completely by simply liquidating the thing. In other words, you are "underwater," as the asset you are attempting to liquidate is worth less than your debt.

The spirit of confusion will make it more difficult for you to realistically mark to market the value of the item you purchased with debt. Because you know that just looking at it will make things more confusing, you won't want to.

***

## Debt-Free Spirits

### Spirit Of Freedom

A place where you are fully in control of how you utilize your ultimate resource: time.

By staying debt-free, the spirit of freedom grows with time.

View it as an asset, akin to a tree that flourishes and bears more fruit as it grows, as long as you remain debt-free. It needs time to grow. When you enter a state of debt, the growth of your spirit of freedom stops, and it resumes when you get out of debt.

The more spirit of freedom you have, the greater your ability to decide how to utilize your time.

If your spirit of freedom is one year old, you have the ability to decide how you spend your time for up to a year. If it's "ten years old," you can determine how to allocate your time for the next ten years.

The longer you stay out of debt, the better you become at understanding and utilizing your remaining time in the future.

### Spirit Of Peace

When you don't have to worry about your next debt payment, you can sleep peacefully and find serenity.

When you have the spirit of peace, you can appreciate what you have more.

Spirit of peace allows you to be fully present.

The spirit of peace has the power to heal both your mind and body, leading to improved overall health.

Your spirit of peace will bring peace to those around you.

### Spirit Of Clarity

Spirit of clarity manifests as a heightened awareness of the value of each purchase you make, for you. If you consider its value for you is greater than the expense, you will choose to buy it. if not, you wonâ€™t.

As your spirit of clarity grows over time, you will continue gaining a more heightened awareness of the value of your purchases for you.

The spirit of clarity will help you keep tabs on your belongings. Once you value an item less than the money it can sell for, youâ€™ll choose to sell it. This will help you keep fine-tuning your net worth composition.

## Debt Effects

### How Your Debt Affects You

Your debt affects your spiritual blueprint. It has an impact on your ability to generate inflows. It has an impact on how you generate outflows.

#### Debt Reduces Your Capacity For Generating Inflows And Increases Your Wasteful Outflows

This may be an obvious point, but it should still be stated explicitly. When you spend on credit (or enter a state of debt), you are still spending money; you are not receiving the item for free.

Often, we miss this point because we mistakenly believe that if we purchase something on credit, even if we don't have enough money to pay for it in full, we are going to get it without having to pay for it. However, we will be making payments for it; they will just be spaced out over the length of the debt.

The fact that we have not yet made a single payment for this item, however, gives us the impression that we received it for free. Even when we begin paying for it, we still have the impression that we obtained it without actually paying for it. Do you get what I mean?

Suppose that you have $10,000 in your bank account and make $4,000 per month. You are looking at a new automobile with a price tag of $50,000. You clearly cannot afford it; even if you emptied your entire bank account, you would still be $40,000 short. However, if the cost of this vehicle is presented to you as $650 per month over the next 84 months, you will only compare two numbers: your current monthly income of $4,000 and the monthly outflow of $650 for this car. Suddenly, it appears that you may be able to purchase and begin driving this vehicle. But there is a great deal of confusion here.

Starting out in this massive confusion, you will try to rationalize why you should actually go for it. You will use this car to get to work, your old car is in need of repairs, this new car will be better and more reliable, etc., you will earn more money in the future, and you really want it now.

However, the true calculation for this automobile is as follows: First, if you paid with cash, you would likely receive a price reduction, perhaps between 5 and 10 percent. And if you multiply $650 payments by 84 months, you'll end up paying $54,600 for the car, as opposed to $47,600 (5% discount) or $45,000 (10% discount). We're talking about a $7,000 to $8,600 difference over 84 months. After that, you must determine the opportunity cost of holding onto this difference if it was saved in bitcoin. At the time of writing, if you held $83 difference per month ($7,000 / 84), your purchasing power would increase 450%, resulting in around $36,000 worth of bitcoin, and if you do the same calculation for 10% discount ($102 per month, $8,600 divided by 84 months), you would end up with around $44,000 worth of bitcoin.

You should also calculate the depreciation of the vehicle over the next seven years and understand that the rate will likely be lower if you purchase the vehicle with cash instead of credit. This is due to the fact that, in general, we tend to care for things more when we own them outright, as opposed to gradually gaining partial ownership as the item is used. There is a reason why leased and financed automobiles are typically in poorer condition after being driven by owners who took on debt to acquire them, compared to the same automobiles driven by cash-paying owners who took better care of them throughout their use. The same is true for any other item you purchase with credit.

#### Your Outflows Are Increased Because Of Interest, Opportunity Cost & Misallocation

Spending credit is always more expensive than spending cash because humans have a positive time preference, which means they prefer present money to future money. The cost of spending future money is expressed in the interest rate.

The price you pay over the life of the debt has two opportunity cost sources: the amount you would save if you paid for the same item with cash and the total interest you will pay over the life of the debt.

Your opportunity cost should be calculated in terms of the appreciation of purchasing power if the money was saved in bitcoin throughout the duration of the debt.

There is a third, frequently overlooked cost of using credit: the opportunity cost of financial decisions made under the influence of the spirits of slavery, restlessness and confution rather than the spirits of freedom, peace and clarity. For instance, your next 30 years of inflows and outflows, as well as decisions regarding your net worth balance, will look very different and have very different outcomes if you a) have 50% of your net worth in debts and b) you have no debts.

The third cost of spending credit should also be calculated in terms of the appreciation of purchasing power if the money was saved in bitcoin throughout the duration of the debt.

#### Your Inflows Are Reduced Because of Lower Risk Tolerance

Your inventory of time is the most valuable asset you have. You take on some level of risk whenever you choose to invest your time in a potential business opportunity; however, you do so with the goal of increasing both the quantity and the quality of your available time.

Risk and return are facets of the same coin.

Even with zero risk and a positive return of X, there is still an opportunity cost associated with taking greater than zero risk and gaining greater than X return. Because of this, there is no real way to avoid taking risks.

There are opportunities, both positive and negative, and both involve taking a risk.

Every claim on your future time (debt) diminishes your ability to take risks with your time.

At a debt-to-assets ratio of 100 percent, all of your time is spent servicing debt, and you cannot afford to take any risks with your time.

This is where you begin to incur significant opportunity costs, because there will be risks greater than zero that will yield a higher return than what you have, but you cannot take them.

#### Debt Decreases Your Ownership Satisfaction

The time you put into working to save for something increases your satisfaction with the item when you buy it.

This is because we care about the things we invest in. Our time investment in something makes it more valuable to us.

Consider the following scenario: you buy a car after saving for it for seven years. You were carefully setting aside a portion of your income for this savings goal over the course of these seven years, and you also had time to learn everything you could about the car and alternatives.

The fact that you waited seven years to buy this car will make it more enjoyable and make you feel like you've upgraded from whatever you were driving before you bought it.

You were able to research everything about it because of the time it took you to save up for it.

You were able to get a price reduction by paying cash.

Additionally, when you began using it, you took care of it by assigning enough money to cover the cost of ownership.

All of this influenced the overall ownership experience.

Now compare this to a situation in which you buy the car on credit now and pay it off over the next 7 years.

First and foremost, you will not have the sense of building up to the purchase of the car, the anticipation and time you put into saving for it. This is going to give you a completely different feeling than if you saved up for it.

However, once you begin using the car, you begin paying for it and investing your time in it. Now the feeling of liking the car increases because you are working for it and paying for it in installments, but it is offset by the feeling of discovering some flaws in the car that you didn't have time to research and investigate because you jumped into debt quickly before hand.

You also don't have a full sense of ownership yet, so you don't take good care of the car. This simply raises the cost of ownership in terms of the depreciation curve, and you begin to avoid looking into the actual market value of the car in relation to your overall debt balance for it (it may already be underwater).

After a while, you end up with a car that is gradually becoming a burden rather than a joy.

#### Debt Increases Your Cost Of Ownership

We take better care of things we own outright.

Taking less care of a debt-purchased item means deferring maintenance costs into the future, which will only increase them later.

Because of this effect, the depreciation curve on something you bought with debt will be steeper than the one you own outright and properly maintain in the best condition possible.

Even worse, you don't really feel like you own the thing for the duration of the debt, but when you finally pay it off, it has depreciated so much that owning it doesn't feel as good as it would if you bought it with savings.

### How Your Debt Affects Others

If you incur debt through the creation of fiat money, it affects others who are forced by the state to hold fiat debt instruments.

#### Your Debt Steals Purchasing Power From The Poor

When you take out a bank loan, you create new fiat money.

Fiat money ceases to exist when you repay the loan or default on it.

The only reason this system works is because of the state's violent coercion, which mandates the use of fiat money in the marketplace through legal tender laws, tax collection in fiat money, and mandates that large financial institutions hold a certain amount of government bonds in their portfolios.

This effectively means that the only reason debt is monetized globally is due to state coercion.

Thus, when you incur debt through any of the fiat-licensed institutions, you effectively leverage the state's coercive power to transfer your credit risk to the fiat-money holders.

Your credit risk will eventually manifest as widespread price inflation.

Inflation is the most regressive form of taxation because it disproportionately affects the poor. Poor people have the majority of their net worth in liquid fiat cash, whereas wealthy people have only a small portion of their net worth in liquid cash.

#### Your Debt Generates Economic Distortions

* real estate monetization
* capital misallocation
* business boom & bust cycles
* price signal distortion
* worsens economic calculation

## Debt And Bitcoin Are Dangerous Combination

Having both debt and Bitcoin on your balance sheet is extremely risky for your net worth management. Staying in debt during Bitcoin bull runs could lead you to FOMO into more debt in order to increase your Bitcoin exposure. Staying in debt during Bitcoin bear markets could lead you to panic and reduce your Bitcoin exposure in order to stay solvent and avoid bankruptcy.&#x20;

The only wise way is to pay off all of your debts first, and then begin accumulating Bitcoin with zero debt on your balance sheet.

### If You Have Debt And Hold Bitcoin, You Risk Losing In Multiple Ways

You may believe that you are profiting from the difference between the interest rate you are paying on debt and the annual growth rate of bitcoin.

However, if you believe this, you are overlooking or forgetting several issues.&#x20;

The first is the opportunity cost of your stress as a result of this action.&#x20;

The second is the increased cost of ownership because you have less money for maintenance of the item you purchased with debt, resulting in a higher real rate of depreciation.&#x20;

And the third is the opportunity cost of not being able to increase the spirit of generosity and income.

Even though your interest rate is a fixed percentage, your perception of the value of the item that you financed may shift over time. When your initial assessment of a product is off, you may end up with something you don't like but are stuck paying for anyway.

You might not stick to your plan if bitcoin gets too volatile. If it rises and you haven't paid off your debt, you may feel compelled to take on even more debt in an effort to "chase the pump." The added pressure of having to keep making payments on an asset you can no longer afford means that you'll be less happy with your possessions than you would be if you didn't have any debt to worry about.

### When You Become Debt-Free, Transition From Fiat To Bitcoin Standard Eases For Everyone

When a commercial bank extends credit, it effectively increases the money supply.

When you pay off a loan or go into default, the money supply decreases.

When you repay your bank loan, you reduce the supply of fiat money, boosting the purchasing power of those who still have fiat in their cash accounts. For everyone else, you raised the interest rate on borrowing, which lowered their desire to do so.

You can do your part to lessen the need for the printing of new fiat money by living debt-free for as long as possible. You being debt-free indirectly increases the cost of borrowing for all borrowers.

People convert their current money to bitcoin (increasing the bitcoin spot price), but they can also convert their credit to bitcoin (leveraged bitcoin buying, going into debt to buy bitcoin, or buying bitcoin while still having debt on the balance sheet).

Credit-funded Bitcoin purchases, however, result in more extreme parabolic price movements, which, when exhausted (when users can no longer take on additional debt), result in even more extreme Bitcoin price crashes due to the liquidation cascade effect.

Without debt, the process of monetising bitcoin would be more stable.

The greater demand you have for holding bitcoin cash balance makes it more valuable, which encourages others to follow suit. If you do this without incurring debt, it becomes even more appealing for lenders to sell their loans and invest in bitcoin instead. If people had less debt, there would be less capital misallocation and less government funding, leading to more free market signal and ultimately more civilization.

### How To Become And Stay Debt-Free?

#### Become Debt-Free

We can usually read and hear about three different debt-reduction strategies.

The first is the debt snowball method, in which you order your debts from smallest to largest and make the minimum payment on all but the smallest, where you pay the most. The goal is to build momentum by paying off small debts first, so you can get "the kick" and be more motivated to pile on the next in line. If you only have a choice between these three methods, I'd go with this one.

The second method is the debt avalanche method, in which you order your debts by the size of their interest rates and pay the minimum on all but the debt with the highest interest rates, where you pay the most. Just mathematically speaking, this will be the quickest way out of debt out of the three. The disadvantage is that it is the most difficult to maintain psychologically.

The third method is debt consolidation, which involves taking on new debt with a single interest rate and duration to pay off all of your existing debts with different maturities and interest rates. This is the easiest, but the main drawback is that you will probably want to choose a longer maturity term for your debt because you will psychologically prefer to have a smaller monthly payment amount. This will keep you in debt for the longest period of time.

My advice is to sell off whatever assets you can and pay off your debt as soon as possible because you will benefit most from spending the least amount of time in debt. This is because, after that, you can proceed to the next phase, which will increase your inflows, by allocating 10% to 20% of your budget to the Giving category.

If you are not convinced about it, I would advise you to continue managing your budget and attempting to make ends meet while retaining your Bitcoin. You can try any of the three mentioned strategies to speed up the process, but ultimately I think the volatility of Bitcoin will eventually force you to decide to simply pay off your debt for good, even if it means big change in your lifestyle.

#### Stay Debt-Free

* never use credit cards
* never borrow money under any circumstance
* only spend from the past
* have at least a third of your net worth in cash balance (high liquidity / salability) -> read about it later in Wisdom For Your Net Worth
* whenever you get the bill, pay it immidiately, the same day you get it
* have at least 3 to 6 months of your regular expenses in savings before you decide to purchase something outside of that
* never try to collect airline miles or fall for cashback offers by credit cards
* never try to get "deals" by making payments instead of purchasing the thing outright
* never fall for foolish idea that "there is good debt and bad debt". all debt will have same spiritual consequences which you want to avoid at all costs
