# Giving In Your Budget

I recommend naming one category in your budget "Giving" and keeping it at 10% to 20% of your current budgeting amount (cash balance).

For example, if you have $10,000 in cash, you should allocate $1,000 to $2,000 to the Giving category.

When you spend from your Giving category, for example, if you buy a $100 gift, you should subtract that from your Giving category, which means it will be $900 or $1,900.

However, when you make transactions from other categories, you should rebalance the amount you assign to Giving, because Giving should always be 10% to 20% of your cash balance.

So, if you pay your rent and utilities for the month (say, $600) after purchasing the gift, your total cash balance drops from $10,000 to $9,300 ($100 from Giving and $600 from Shelter). This means that your new Giving category target should be 10% to 20% of $9,300, or between $930 and $1,860.

You will notice that by calculating your Giving category in this manner, you cannot completely deplete it unless you spend all of your money at the same time. This is deliberate, because your giving budget must always be available to you and must adjust in accordance with your current cash balance.
