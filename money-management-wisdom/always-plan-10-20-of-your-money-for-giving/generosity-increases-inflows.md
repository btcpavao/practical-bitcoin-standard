# Giving Increases Capacity For Generating Inflows

If you earned your money through a voluntary, consensual exchange with another person, that person (your employer, client, or customer) valued the good or service you provided more than the money he paid you for it. As a result, the act of earning money is valuable in and of itself, and you are already acting morally when you are earning money. Voluntary exchange generates value for both parties.

"Giving back to society" is one of the worst phrases you will ever hear. If you pause and think about it, the phrase "giving back to society" implies that by earning money, you somehow took it away from society (thus, you are now giving it back). The right approach is to say that by earning your money, you already generated value for society, and by giving to charity, you want to improve your ability to earn money, which means you will be bringing even more value to society.

Giving money will make you more capable and better at earning money, because it will make you better at serving your customers. Your customers will like you more if you have a generous spirit because you'll be a more enjoyable person to be around. They will be more inclined to provide you with honest feedback on your goods or services, which will have a positive ripple effect on all your business operations down the line.

Also, you won't spend as much time worrying about insignificant problems that can occur in any business. When you make a mistake in business, such as selecting the incorrect partner or supplier or running into a "bad" customer who is dissatisfied with your offering and requests a refund, you will be able to quickly move on from them, learn your lesson, but do so in a way that doesn't use up any of your creative ability. This is due to the fact that you can always consider this expense to be a part of your overall giving. This frees you up to focus on what matters, which is figuring out how to serve your customers more effectively.

Generous people generally have better moods and a brighter, happier outlook on life. We all enjoy being around them because we don't feel they expect anything from us. They are simply allowing us to benefit from their state of being without taking anything away from them. It's like sunshine: if I enjoy it, it doesn't take away from someone else's enjoyment of it.

A generous person will always approach business negotiations from a win-win rather than a win-lose perspective. The negotiating party will always pick up on this and adopt it as well. And for a generous person, when they ocassionaly realize the counterparty is trying hard to negotiate down, they may still accept the deal to make the other person happy they won the negotiation. A generous person will always default to a long-term perspective: even if I don't make money on this particular deal - this negotiation is a win for me because it increased my generosity.

This has tremendous business power.
