# Giving Increases Risk Tolerance

In our professional lives, we will constantly come across opportunities to take risks with favorable rewards.

In other words, we have many opportunities with a favorable risk/reward ratio.

When we regularly practice giving, we naturally increase our overall risk tolerance and are able to take on higher risks with higher rewards.

This is because we are already accustomed to spending money without expecting anything in return, other than our spirit of generosity growing.

So, in this context, even if we make an investment with a favorable risk/return ratio but do not make the return, we are still benefiting and are not subject to the sunk cost fallacy.
