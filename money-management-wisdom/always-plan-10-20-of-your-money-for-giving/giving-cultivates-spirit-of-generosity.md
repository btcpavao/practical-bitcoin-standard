# Giving Cultivates Spirit Of Generosity

You grow the spirit of generosity each and every time you make a financial transaction without expecting anything in return (defined as a giving transaction, that is, a transaction that deducted money from your budget's Giving category).

Consider it like watering a seed; as you continue to water it, it will eventually grow larger.

Most of the time, people immediately feel the effect of stimulating the growth of spirit of generosity. It's an incredibly uplifting feeling that can brighten your day on its own.

Not only that, but the emotion sort of lingers even after the transaction has been completed and some time has passed. Every new giving transaction you complete sort of builds upon the one before, creating a cumulative effect.

You become more and more immersed in this spirit as time goes on. It is similar to an aura, radiates outwards more and more, and has no cap on how large it can get.

Being generous also has the effect of granting you a sort of "permission" to enjoy spending your money on yourself. Most often, even if their budget allows for it and they want it, people who don't practice giving will feel guilty if they want to buy something for themselves that they deem "too expensive" or just "too much." This is true even if their budget allows for it and they want it. Giving transactions as a regular practice can help to reduce this subconcious sense of guilt.

Make a giving transaction in advance of any potentially stressful professional situation you may be in (such as a job interview, a difficult client negotiation you might anticipate, or the hiring or firing of an employee). Any communication benefits from having at least one party with a spirit of generosity.
