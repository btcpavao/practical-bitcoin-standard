# Age Of Money

The age of money is the average time between earning and spending your money, measured in days. In other words, how long did the money you used to make a transaction sit around in your accounts, on average.

The greater this number, the simpler it is to manage money in general. The longer our money ages, the more time we have to make decisions about its opportunity cost. The longer we age our money, the more the time dimension of money is revealed.

If this is your first time budgeting, don't get too caught up in the age of money number. If you follow the principles outlined in this guidebook, your money age will increase naturally over time.
