# Assets

Assets include everything we own.&#x20;

These include money in bank accounts, Bitcoin, investments, stocks, bonds, real estate, artwork, cars, and so forth. Budget and Tracking are the two distinct sections where assets are grouped. Every liquid and highly salable asset — what we would call money — that we use to allocate to budget categories is included in the budgeting section, which is also where we track our inflows and outflows.&#x20;

The Tracking section  is for monitoring the market value of our assets that are not included in our budget categories and are less liquid / salable than cash. These include, for instance, automobiles and real estate, non-liquid investments like bond & stock portfolios, private equity and so on.
