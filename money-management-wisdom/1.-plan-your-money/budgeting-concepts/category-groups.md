# Category Groups

* it is useful to group similar categories together in a Category Group
* for example, you can create two main Category Groups: Essentials and Discretionary
* then, you can break down the categories that you consider essential (neccessary, non-negotiable, needed) and group them together under Essentials, and do the same for Discretionary
