# Budgeting Concepts

### Age Of Money

The age of money is the average time between earning and spending your money, measured in days. In other words, how long did the money you used to make a transaction sit around in your accounts, on average.

The greater this number, the simpler it is to manage money in general. The longer our money ages, the more time we have to make decisions about its opportunity cost. The longer we age our money, the more the time dimension of money is revealed.

If this is your first time budgeting, don't get too caught up in the age of money number. If you follow the principles outlined in this guidebook, your money age will increase naturally over time.

### Assets

Assets include everything we own.&#x20;

These include money in bank accounts, Bitcoin, investments, stocks, bonds, real estate, artwork, cars, and so forth. Budget and Tracking are the two distinct sections where assets are grouped. Every liquid and highly salable asset — what we would call money — that we use to allocate to budget categories is included in the budgeting section, which is also where we track our inflows and outflows.&#x20;

The Tracking section  is for monitoring the market value of our assets that are not included in our budget categories and are less liquid / salable than cash. These include, for instance, automobiles and real estate, non-liquid investments like bond & stock portfolios, private equity and so on.

### Budget Categories

* spending or saving priorities
* specifically, they represent opportunity cost of your money

### Category Groups

* it is useful to group similar categories together in a Category Group
* for example, you can create two main Category Groups: Essentials and Discretionary
* then, you can break down the categories that you consider essential (neccessary, non-negotiable, needed) and group them together under Essentials, and do the same for Discretionary

### Debts (Liabilities)

Debts (liabilities) include everything we owe. For example, cash loans, credit card balances, auto loans, student loans, mortgages, leases, home equity lines of credit, and any other secured or unsecured debts we have. These are monitored based on their current balance.

### Income Vs Expense Report

The Income v Expense report displays all of your budget inflows and outflows over time and can be filtered by budget category and budget account. You will be able to see all of your income sources as well as all of your expenses organized by category. Here you can see the total income and total expenses for the whole budget period, as well as the average monthly income and average monthly expenses.

### Inflows & Outflows

Inflow refers to money coming in.&#x20;

Outflow refers to money going out.&#x20;

Our inflow and outflow levels can be compared over time.&#x20;

If more money comes in than goes out, you will have a positive net income. When outflows are higher than inflows, you have negative net income.&#x20;

Your average net income is calculated over time.&#x20;

Task: Check your income and expenses once a week. Take a look at your net income. Limit your search to a single category.

### Net Income

Net income is the difference between your income and expenses. It can be viewed as part of the Income vs. Expense Report and is calculated as the total net income for the duration of the budget, or per month on average for the selected duration.

### Net Worth

Your net worth is the sum of your assets minus your debts (liabilities).

For example, if you own a $100,000 house, a $15,000 car, $10,000 in your bank account, and $5,000 in investments, your assets are worth $130,000. If you also have a $4,000 credit card balance, a $80,000 mortgage, and a $10,000 car loan, you should subtract your $94,000 liabilities from your $130,000 assets to get your net worth, which is $36,000 in this case.

Net worth can be tracked over time.

### Payees

Payee is any party (person or legal entity) with whom we make incoming or outgoing transactions.

Why should we keep track of our payees? Because we need to know precisely where our inflows and outflows occur, so we can make better decisions about who we transact with over time.

### Running Balance

* this is the amount of money you have in your account
* you can have multiple accounts where you hold money
* each time you make a transaction from an account, the running balance number changes
* cleared balance: the total of all transactions that are not currently pending
* uncleared balance: transactions that you entered manually, but are pending for clearance
* working balance: the sum of cleared and uncleared transactions: the money you have available to spend
* scheduled transactions: running balance is useful when you need to know how much money you will need to have in the account from which you'll be making payment in the future

### Scheduled Transactions

Scheduled transactions are all the ones that will happen in the future. Let's say we know that our rent is due on the 15th of next month, but today is the 1st of the month. We should enter a scheduled transaction for the 15th.

Some transactions are recurring. For example, we may have a monthly internet bill. You can create recurring transactions in your budget, and once you pay them, they will appear in the budget's scheduled transactions.

Both inflows and outflows can be set up as scheduled transactions.

### Spending Totals

You can filter the spending totals report by time period, account, and category to see a visual breakdown of your expenses. This is useful if, for instance, you wish to determine which category has the largest amount relative to your total expenses over the particular duration of time.

### Spending Trends

Spending Trends is a helpful visual representation of your monthly total spending by category. This is useful for examining how your spending has changed over time.

### Transaction Memo

Memo is where you can describe the transaction. In most cases, I simply record the transaction's details and include a list of the goods I bought on the invoice. You can use this field to go into much greater detail about the transaction. The more descriptive you are, the more insight you will gain upon revisiting the transaction in the future.

### Transfer Transactions

* a transaction that you are doing by moving money between accounts in your budget
* example: moving money from one checking account to another one
