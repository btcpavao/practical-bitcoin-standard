# Plan Your Money

The first and most crucial step is to take full control of your money. This means developing the habit of always having a plan for every dollar before spending any of it, which can be achieved by practicing zero-based budgeting.

## Why Practice Budgeting?

One of the major misconceptions about budgeting is the belief that it solely involves reducing spending or tracking expenses. In reality, budgeting is about allocating our money, giving it a specific plan or purpose before we spend it. "Planning" might be a more accurate term, or even "economizing." Additionally, budgeting is a process of managing money; it is not a particular destination we arrive at and stay.

This manual will focus specifically on the practice of zero-based budgeting. In this context, "zero-based" means that we assign all of our money to each budget category until there is no more money to be assigned. For example, if we have $1,000 in our budget and only assign $200 to a category, we still have $800 to assign. The budget is not zero-based until we decide how to assign the remaining $800 to specific category/categories.

**So why bother doing this?**

If you have never practiced budgeting, chances are you have some level of disorder in your financial life. Our first objective is to bring this aspect of your life into perfect order, and it's entirely achievable, regardless of the current state of disorder. In fact, it's quite straightforward.

The moment you establish your budget for the first time (which typically doesn't require more than an afternoon), you'll experience a noticeable shift in your sense of control over your finances. People often report feeling like they've received a substantial raise after creating their first budget.

Every subsequent transaction you record in your budget maintains this perfect order and sense of control over your money. However, if you neglect to record a transaction or stop maintaining your budget altogether, you initiate a process of entropy, gradually bringing disorder back into your financial life.

The good news is that when you return and start fresh once again, recreating your budget, perfect order is instantly restored. Afterward, you simply need to sustain it by promptly entering transactions into your budget as you make them, keeping it up to date and balanced.

As time goes on, you'll discover a natural ebb and flow to this process. You may find yourself increasingly irritated when you slip up and reintroduce disorder into your financial life. You will realize that you can uphold perfect order in this area with just a few minutes of attention each day, and the more time you invest in fine-tuning your budget, the wiser your financial decisions will become. Eventually, you won't want to return to disorder.

Without budgeting, our money management tends to be guided by emotions rather than rational decision-making. Some of us become overly frugal, while others become too lenient and sloppy. This is because without a budget, we lack clarity regarding the opportunity cost and time dimension of our money. When making spending decisions, we typically compare the immediate transaction amount with our approximate total available funds. Consequently, our decision-making hinges on our feelings in the moment, often leading to post-purchase regrets. When we start budgeting, this sense of regret disappears.

Without budgeting, it's challenging to recall how we've been spending our money, apart from having a vague idea for a short period. There's a general sense of uncertainty about our spending habits. Our lack of historical spending data hinders our ability to plan for future expenditures. When we adopt budgeting, we gain a precise understanding of when, how much, on what, and where we spend our money. As we accumulate this data, we grow better equipped to plan our financial future.

Before budgeting, many of us are apprehensive about delving deep into our money situation because we are uncertain how we'll feel. We want to avoid feeling bad about our money situation. However, once we start budgeting, we'll find the practice increasingly enjoyable on a daily basis.

Some common challenges and bad habits we encounter when not practicing budgeting include:

* Living paycheck to paycheck.
* Falling for messages promoting debt.
* Believing we couldn't afford certain things without debt.
* Underestimating the emotional toll of handling money unwisely.
* Lacking a sense of control over our money.
* Having a generally higher time preference (preferring immediate rewards over delayed gratification).
* Not understanding the concept of opportunity cost.
* Not understanding the time dimension of money.

The more we practice budgeting, the better we'll become at it. There is no set time limit for when we ought to stop practicing it because if we continue for ten years, we will have refined our skills and will be able to make accurate plans for the next ten years.

### Categorize Your Money To Define Its Opportunity Cost

In order to gain full control over our money, we first have to decide its opportunity cost. Without budgeting, our money's opportunity cost remains undecided. Let's illustrate this through an example story.

Imagine we have $5,000 in our bank account, which is all the money we have at the moment. Should we go to a nice restaurant that has an average dinner price of about $100 if we really want to?

Without zero-based budgeting in place, our decision-making process is as follows: we look at our bank account, see $5,000, and may think, "Well, $5,000 is much more than $100, so we can afford this," and then go out to eat.

In our example, sitting down to a $100 dinner means we gave up $100 worth of alternatives on something we hadn't decided on before. In other words, because we spent $100 on dinner, we are unable to spend the same amount on something else. Even though this may seem like a simple idea, it can be difficult to fully understand what it means without first assigning money in our budget.

Returning to our previous example of having $5,000 in our bank account, suppose we made a zero-based budget one afternoon a couple of weeks before we came across the restaurant. In this case, we put a fifth of our $5,000, or $1,000, into the Giving category of our budget. We'll talk more about this in later chapters.

A further fifth of our budget, or $1,000, was assigned to cover our housing expenses (rent, utilities, upkeep, etc.). We set aside $1,000 for groceries, $1,000 for transportation, and $1,000 for "Everything Else" (which could include things like clothing, hobbies, travel, dining out, etc.). We could further subdivide these categories, but let's keep it simple for now.

When deciding whether to spend $100 on dinner right now, we are not looking at the total amount of money in our bank account ($5,000), but rather at our "Everything Else" category, which has $1,000 available.

Here is how our budget looks:

**Total Budget: $5,000**

* Giving: $1,000
* Shelter: $1,000
* Groceries: $1,000
* Transport: $1,000
* Everything Else: $1,000

We now know that if we spend $100 on this dinner, we will have $900 left in the "Everything Else" category. We decide that we value the dinner experience more than retaining $1,000 in the "Everything Else" category and enjoy it. Additionally, we give the waiter a $20 tip, which we subtract from the Giving category, bringing it down from $1,000 to $980.

The remaining amount in our overall budget is $4,880. Here is how it looks now:

**Total Budget: $4,880**

* Giving: $980
* Shelter: $1,000
* Groceries: $1,000
* Transport: $1,000
* Everything Else: $900

We decide to adhere to one of the three timeless money management principles and always keep 20% of our total budget in the Giving category (again, more on this later). This means we should have $976 instead of $980 in the Giving category. So, we decide to move $4 from "Giving" to another budget category, like "Everything Else." This means that our budget now looks like this:

**Total Budget: $4,880**

* Giving: $976
* Shelter: $1,000
* Groceries: $1,000
* Transport: $1,000
* Everything Else: $904

Imagine that one day after dinner, on the way to work, we stop at a gas station, fill up the tank, and pay $65 to do so. We deduct it from the Transport category, bringing its amount down from $1,000 to $935. Our total budget is now $4,815.

**Total Budget: $4,815**

* Giving: $976
* Shelter: $1,000
* Groceries: $1,000
* Transport: $935
* Everything Else: $904

We again apply the timeless principle of keeping our Giving category at 20% of the total budget, so we transfer $13 from Giving back to Transport, resulting in the following budget breakdown:

**Total Budget: $4,815**

* Giving: $963
* Shelter: $1,000
* Groceries: $1,000
* Transport: $948
* Everything Else: $904

Now imagine that a few days later, we spend $50 on a birthday present for a friend. We deduct $50 from the Giving category, bringing it down from $963 to $913, leaving us with a total budget of $4,765.

**Total Budget: $4,765**

* Giving: $913
* Shelter: $1,000
* Groceries: $1,000
* Transport: $948
* Everything Else: $904

Once more, we apply the timeless money management principle of keeping 20% of our total budget ($4,765) in the Giving category ($953), so we move $40 from another category, this time Groceries, to Giving. We arrive at the following budget breakdown:

**Total Budget: $4,765**

* Giving: $953
* Shelter: $1,000
* Groceries: $960
* Transport: $948
* Everything Else: $904

Then, the day arrives when we usually pay for our rent and utilities, like the mobile phone bill. Our rent is $400, and our mobile phone bill is $25. Let's also imagine we do our weekly grocery shopping and spend $120 at the grocery store. Our budget now looks like this:

**Total Budget: $4,220**

* Giving: $953
* Shelter: $600
* Groceries: $840
* Transport: $948
* Everything Else: $879

Again, we calculate that our Giving category should be at 20% of the total budget, which is $844 instead of $953. We move $109 from Giving to Shelter and also decide to move $100 from Transport to Shelter, so everything is a bit more balanced. Our budget now looks like this:

**Total Budget: $4,220**

* Giving: $844
* Shelter: $809
* Groceries: $840
* Transport: $848
* Everything Else: $879

Now, let's imagine a couple of days later, we get our $1,500 paycheck:

**Total Budget: $5,220**

* Giving: $844
* Shelter: $809
* Groceries: $840
* Transport: $848
* Everything Else: $879

We know we should have 20% of the budget in Giving ($1,044), and we decide to top up the rest of the categories as well. We end up with this:

**Total Budget: $5,220**

* Giving: $1,044
* Shelter: $1,106
* Groceries: $1,020
* Transport: $1,020
* Everything Else: $1,030

### Budgeting Allows You To See Your Money's Time Dimension

The total amount of money we have can be viewed through the lens of time. We have money in the present that we earned in the past, and we own money in the future that we have not yet earned. We can choose to transact in the present with money that we have already earned in the past or with money that we have not yet earned in the future.

We know with absolute certainty how much money we have made in the past. However, the money that we have yet to earn in the future is completely uncertain. This is due to the fact that we can never be certain of how much time we have left to live and earn money because of the nature of time. As a result, we can never predict how much money we will have in the future.

When we look at our current money situation, it's like looking at a still photo, a snapshot. We know how much money we have right now. However, our money exists in a continuous flow of time, and we have to get used to looking at it through that lens as well. We can only gain this perspective by practicing budgeting over some period of time. If we keep doing it for a few months, for example, we'll start to see our money situation more like a video than a snapshot.

As we do this, we naturally begin using past budgeting information to adjust our budget to better fit our future plans and goals. The longer we practice budgeting, the further ahead we can look and plan. We'll start tracking our "age of money" to see how it changes based on how much we put into each category and when we spend it. We'll learn how to increase this number, which will give us more financial peace and clarity.

We'll also learn how to use savings goals. For example, if we want to save $20,000 for a car and we already have $2,000 in our Transport category, we can set a goal to save $20,000. Then, our $2,000 in the Transportation category means we're 10% closer to our savings goal. We can also contextualize our goals in the dimension of time. In this example, if we want to reach our $20,000 target in the next two years, we will realize that we have to assign $750 to the Transportation category each month for the next 24 months to get there.

## Budgeting Concepts

### Age Of Money

The "age of money" refers to the average number of days between earning and spending your money. Essentially, it measures how long, on average, your money remains in your accounts before being used for transactions.

A higher age of money indicates easier overall money management. The longer your money sits in your accounts, the more time you have to consider its opportunity cost and make informed decisions.

If you're new to budgeting, don't worry too much about the age of money. By following the principles in this guidebook, your money's age will naturally increase over time.

### Assets

Assets include everything we own, such as money in bank accounts, Bitcoin, investments, stocks, bonds, real estate, artwork, and cars. These assets are categorized into two sections: Budget and Tracking.

The Budget section includes all liquid and highly salable assets, essentially what we consider money, which we allocate to various budget categories. This section also tracks our inflows and outflows.

The Tracking section monitors the market value of assets not included in our budget categories and those that are less liquid or salable than cash. These assets include automobiles, real estate, non-liquid investments like bond and stock portfolios, private equity, and similar items.

### Budget Categories

Budget categories are the areas to which you assign your money. For example, when you purchase groceries, you enter the transaction under the Groceries category.

The main purpose of these categories in your budget is to clearly represent the opportunity cost of your money.

### Category Groups

It is useful to group similar categories together in a Category Group. For example, you can create two major Category Groups: Essentials and Discretionary.

In the Essentials Category Group, you can organize necessary, non-negotiable, and needed categories. Similarly, you can group non-essential, flexible spending categories under Discretionary.

Here is an example:

**Essentials Category Group:**

* Shelter & Utilities
* Groceries
* Transportation
* Clothing

**Discretionary Category Group:**

* Hobbies
* Vacation
* Restaurants

### Debts (Liabilities)

Debts (liabilities) include everything we owe. Examples are cash loans, credit card balances, auto loans, student loans, mortgages, leases, home equity lines of credit, and any other secured or unsecured debts. These are monitored based on their current balances.

### Income Vs Expense Report

The Income vs. Expense report displays all your budget inflows and outflows over time and can be filtered by budget category and budget account. This report shows all your income sources and expenses organized by category. You can view the total income and total expenses for the entire budget period, as well as the average monthly income and average monthly expenses.

### Inflows & Outflows

Inflow refers to money coming in, while outflow refers to money going out. We can compare our inflow and outflow levels over time. If more money comes in than goes out, you will have a positive net income. Conversely, if outflows are higher than inflows, you will have a negative net income. Your average net income is calculated over time.

**Task:** Check your income and expenses once a week. Review your net income and limit your search to a single category.

### Net Income

Net income is the difference between your income and expenses. It can be viewed as part of the Income vs. Expense Report. Net income is calculated as the total net income for the entire budget duration or as the average monthly net income for the selected period.

### Net Worth

Your net worth is the sum of your assets minus your debts (liabilities). For example, if you own a $100,000 house, a $15,000 car, $10,000 in your bank account, and $5,000 in investments, your assets total $130,000. If you also have a $4,000 credit card balance, an $80,000 mortgage, and a $10,000 car loan, you should subtract your $94,000 in liabilities from your $130,000 in assets to get your net worth, which is $36,000 in this case. Net worth can be tracked over time.

### Payees

A payee is any party (person or legal entity) with whom we make incoming or outgoing transactions.

Why should we keep track of our payees? It allows us to know exactly where our inflows and outflows occur, enabling us to make better decisions about who we transact with over time.

### Running Balance

The running balance is the amount of money in your account that is readily available when needed. You can hold money in multiple accounts, and every time you make a transaction from an account, the running balance changes.

**Cleared balance** is the total of all transactions that are not currently pending.

**Uncleared balance** includes transactions that you manually entered but are still pending clearance.

**Working balance** is the sum of cleared and uncleared transactions, representing the money you have available to spend.

**Scheduled transactions:** The running balance is useful for understanding how much money you'll need in the account for future transactions.

### Scheduled Transactions

Scheduled transactions are those that are set to occur in the future. For example, if we know our rent is due on the 15th of next month and today is the 1st, we should enter a scheduled transaction for the 15th.

Some transactions are recurring, such as a monthly internet bill. You can create these recurring transactions in your budget, and once you pay them, they will appear in the budget's scheduled transactions.

Both inflows and outflows can be set up as scheduled transactions.

### Spending Totals

You can filter the spending totals report by time period, account, and category to see a visual breakdown of your expenses. This is useful if you want to determine which category has the largest amount relative to your total expenses over a specific duration.

### Spending Breakdown

### Spending Trends

Spending Trends is a helpful visual representation of your monthly total spending by category. This tool is useful for examining how your spending patterns have changed over time.

### Targets

* Spending Category Target Options
  * Needed For Spending Targets
    * Weekly
    * Monthly
    * Yearly
    * Custom
  * Monthly Rollover
* Savings Balance Targets
  * With Date
  * Without Date
* Monthly Savings Builder Targets
* Monthly Debt Payment Target
  * If the Category is Not Paired with a Loan Account
  * If the Category is Paired with a Loan Account
* Credit Card Payment Category Targets
  * Pay Off Balance By Date
  * Pay Specific Amount Each Month

***

### Transaction Memo

The memo field is where you can describe the transaction. In most cases, I record the transaction details and include a list of the goods I bought on the invoice. You can use this field to provide much greater detail about the transaction. The more descriptive you are, the more insight you will gain when revisiting the transaction in the future.

### Transfer Transactions

A transfer transaction is one in which you move money from one account in your budget to another. This type of transaction does not affect how your money is assigned to budget categories or the total amount of money you have.

An example of a transfer transaction is moving money from one checking account to another at the same bank. Note that transferring money between accounts can sometimes result in a transfer fee.

## How To Make A Zero Based Budget

To understand how the method works, it's best to start with a simple budget. Here's a step-by-step guide using both the pen and paper (envelope) method and the YNAB software:

#### Pen and Paper (Envelope) Method:

1. **Set Up Your Envelopes:**
   * Take two envelopes and label one "Essentials" and the other "Discretionary." These are your main categories.
2. **Practice Moving Money:**
   * Begin by practicing moving money between envelopes. This will help you get comfortable with budgeting.
3. **Create a Zero-Based Budget:**
   * Write down a scenario where you have $100 in total.
   * Assign amounts to three different categories. For example, "I have $100, so I'm going to assign $30 to Category 1, $40 to Category 2, and $30 to Category 3."
4. **Record Transactions:**
   * Imagine spending $10 from one of the categories. For example, if you spend $10 from Category 2, you now have $90 left in total.
   * Adjust the balance in Category 2: $40 - $10 = $30 remaining.
5. **Repeat for Further Expenses:**
   * Continue this process for any additional expenses or income adjustments. This manual tracking helps you stay aware of your budget.

#### Using YNAB:

1. **Count Your Money:**
   * Start by counting all the money you have right now, including cash, checking accounts, savings accounts, etc.
2. **Enter Balances into YNAB:**
   * Write down or enter these amounts into YNAB. For example, if you have $34 in your wallet, add an account named "Wallet" with a balance of $34.
   * Similarly, add your checking account. If it has $2,344.42, add an account named "Checking Account" with a balance of $2,344.42.
3. **Add All Accounts:**
   * Add any other accounts where you have money. YNAB will sum up all the balances from your accounts, showing the total amount available to assign.
4. **Assign Money to Categories:**
   * Delete the template categories in YNAB and create your own categories.
   * Assign your money to these categories until everything is allocated.
5. **Track Assets and Liabilities:**
   * For assets and liabilities not part of your cash balance, list them separately to track your net worth.
   * Add tracking accounts for items like the value of your home (asset) and any outstanding loans (liabilities).

By starting with these simple steps, you'll get a feel for budgeting and be able to track your income and expenses effectively.

### Mission: 180 Days Of Budgeting Practice

Start by setting up your budget according to the instructions provided in the previous chapter. Then, make sure to keep track of all your inflows and outflows for a continuous period of 180 days. After this six-month period, you should be prepared to answer the following questions:

* What is your age of money?
* What was your net worth three months ago, including both your assets and liabilities?
* How much did you spend on groceries four months ago?
* What was your average net income in the past six months?
* What was your net income two months ago?
* Which category comprises the largest percentage of your spending, and what is that percentage?
* What was your average monthly spending in the past six months?
* What was your total spending in the past six months?

Remember, you can create a zero-based budget with a physical notebook and pen. The main thing you need to do is enter each transaction you make, including the date, payee, amount, category, and description.

Once you understand how this works, it doesn't matter which tool you use. You can also create your budget using any spreadsheet software. Personally, I prefer using YNAB software for zero-based budgeting.
