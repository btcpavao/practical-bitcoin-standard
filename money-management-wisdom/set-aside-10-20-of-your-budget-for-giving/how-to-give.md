# How To Give?

Giving smaller amounts more frequently is preferable to larger amounts less frequently.

Never go a year without making a single transaction from the Giving category.

Family comes first, then friends, then acquaintances, then the local community, and so on. The closer people are to your circle, the higher the priority.

If the giving is for charity, the best way is for the beneficiary to be unaware that you are a benefactor. You must always consider the dignity of the benefactor. Always keep the dignity of the benefactor in mind.

If the above is not possible (because the beneficiary will know who you are), the second best option is to give as an investment in their business (with no expectation of a return on your end).

Third, offer a no-interest loan with no expected return date (and no expectations of return on your end).

The third option is to provide a loan with no interest and no projected return date, along with no expectations of return from you.

This is a lifelong journey that you should continue and get better and wiser about over time; there is no end point to this practice.
