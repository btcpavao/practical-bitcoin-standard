# Keep At Least A Third Of Your Net Worth In Liquid Budget For Giving

* if giving budget falls below 1/60 of total net worth value, it's not going to affect growth of spirit of generosity

On a gold standard, keeping a large amount of liquidity in gold meant paying a high cost for storage, security, insurance, and transfer.

On a fiat standard, having a lot of fiat cash on hand (either physical notes or digitally in bank accounts) means that your purchasing power will go down over time as the fiat money supply rises.

Giving transactions have no effect on the growth of the spirit of generosity if your giving budget falls below 1.7% of your total net worth.

Giving budgets ranging from 1.7% to 3.3% of total net worth will have a reduced impact on the growth of the spirit of generosity.

Giving budgets exceeding 6.7% of total net worth will have a progressively stronger effect on the growth of the spirit of generosity.

You need a lot of liquidity in your net worth to avoid feeling like your giving transactions are too difficult.

To put it another way, hold onto at least one-third of your net worth in cash (we'll go over how to use Bitcoin as your primary money and cash balance later).

This is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity to carry out giving transactions without hesitation.
