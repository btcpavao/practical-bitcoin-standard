# Navigating The Time Dimension Of Money

When we look at our current money situation, it's like looking at a still photo, a snapshot. We know how much money we have right now.&#x20;

However, our money exists in a continuous flow of time, and we have to get used to looking at it through that lens as well. We can only gain this perspective by practicing budgeting over some amount of time. If we keep doing it for a few months for example, we'll start to see our money situation more similar to a video than a snapshot.

As we do this, we naturally begin using past budgeting information to adjust our budget to better fit our future plans & goals. The longer we practice budgeting, the further ahead we can look and plan. We'll start tracking our "age of money" to see how it changes based on how much we put into each category and when we spend it. We'll learn how to increase this number, which will give us more financial peace and clarity.

We'll also learn how to use savings goals. For example, if we want to save $20,000 for a car and we already have $2,000 in our Transport category, we can set a goal to save $20,000. Then, our $2,000 in the Transportation category means we're 10% closer to our savings goal. We can also contextualize our goals in dimension of time. In this example, if we want to reach our $20,000 target in the next two years, we will realize that we have to assign $750 in Transportation category each month for the next 24 months to get there.
