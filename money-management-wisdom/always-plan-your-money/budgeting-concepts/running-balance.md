# Running Balance

* this is the amount of money you have in your account
* you can have multiple accounts where you hold money
* each time you make a transaction from an account, the running balance number changes
* cleared balance: the total of all transactions that are not currently pending
* uncleared balance: transactions that you entered manually, but are pending for clearance
* working balance: the sum of cleared and uncleared transactions: the money you have available to spend
* scheduled transactions: running balance is useful when you need to know how much money you will need to have in the account from which you'll be making payment in the future
