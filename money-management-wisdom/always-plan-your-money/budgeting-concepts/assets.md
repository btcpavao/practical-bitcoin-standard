# Assets

Assets include everything you own. These include money in bank accounts, Bitcoin, investments, stocks, bonds, real estate, artwork, cars, and so forth. Budget and Tracking are the two distinct sections where assets are grouped. Every liquid asset—what we would call money—that you use to allocate to budget categories is included in the budgeting section, which is also where you track your inflows and outflows. This section is for monitoring the market value of your assets that are not included in your budget categories and are less liquid than cash. These include, for instance, automobiles and real estate, non-liquid investments like bond & stock portfolios, private equity and so on.
