# Transaction Memo

Memo is where you can describe the transaction. In most cases, I simply record the transaction's details and include a list of the goods I bought on the invoice. You can use this field to go into much greater detail about the transaction. The more descriptive you are, the more insight you will gain upon revisiting the transaction in the future.
