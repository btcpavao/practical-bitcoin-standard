# Scheduled Transactions

Scheduled transactions are all the ones that will happen in the future. Let's say we know that our rent is due on the 15th of next month, but today is the 1st of the month. We should enter a scheduled transaction for the 15th.

Some transactions are recurring. For example, we may have a monthly internet bill. You can create recurring transactions in your budget, and once you pay them, they will appear in the budget's scheduled transactions.

Both inflows and outflows can be set up as scheduled transactions.
