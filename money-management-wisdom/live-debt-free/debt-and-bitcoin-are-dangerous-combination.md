# Debt And Bitcoin Are Dangerous Combination

Having both debt and Bitcoin on your balance sheet is extremely risky for your net worth management. Staying in debt during Bitcoin bull runs could lead you to FOMO into more debt in order to increase your Bitcoin exposure. Staying in debt during Bitcoin bear markets could lead you to panic and reduce your Bitcoin exposure in order to stay solvent and avoid bankruptcy.&#x20;

The only wise way is to pay off all of your debts first, and then begin accumulating Bitcoin with zero debt on your balance sheet.

## If You Have Debt And Hold Bitcoin, You Risk Losing In Multiple Ways

You may believe that you are profiting from the difference between the interest rate you are paying on debt and the annual growth rate of bitcoin.

However, if you believe this, you are overlooking or forgetting several issues.&#x20;

The first is the opportunity cost of your stress as a result of this action.&#x20;

The second is the increased cost of ownership because you have less money for maintenance of the item you purchased with debt, resulting in a higher real rate of depreciation.&#x20;

And the third is the opportunity cost of not being able to increase the spirit of generosity and income.

Even though your interest rate is a fixed percentage, your perception of the value of the item that you financed may shift over time. When your initial assessment of a product is off, you may end up with something you don't like but are stuck paying for anyway.

You might not stick to your plan if bitcoin gets too volatile. If it rises and you haven't paid off your debt, you may feel compelled to take on even more debt in an effort to "chase the pump." The added pressure of having to keep making payments on an asset you can no longer afford means that you'll be less happy with your possessions than you would be if you didn't have any debt to worry about.

## When You Become Debt-Free, Transition From Fiat To Bitcoin Standard Eases For Everyone

When a commercial bank extends credit, it effectively increases the money supply.

When you pay off a loan or go into default, the money supply decreases.

When you repay your bank loan, you reduce the supply of fiat money, boosting the purchasing power of those who still have fiat in their cash accounts. For everyone else, you raised the interest rate on borrowing, which lowered their desire to do so.

You can do your part to lessen the need for the printing of new fiat money by living debt-free for as long as possible. You being debt-free indirectly increases the cost of borrowing for all borrowers.

People convert their current money to bitcoin (increasing the bitcoin spot price), but they can also convert their credit to bitcoin (leveraged bitcoin buying, going into debt to buy bitcoin, or buying bitcoin while still having debt on the balance sheet).

Credit-funded Bitcoin purchases, however, result in more extreme parabolic price movements, which, when exhausted (when users can no longer take on additional debt), result in even more extreme Bitcoin price crashes due to the liquidation cascade effect.

Without debt, the process of monetising bitcoin would be more stable.

The greater demand you have for holding bitcoin cash balance makes it more valuable, which encourages others to follow suit. If you do this without incurring debt, it becomes even more appealing for lenders to sell their loans and invest in bitcoin instead. If people had less debt, there would be less capital misallocation and less government funding, leading to more free market signal and ultimately more civilization.
