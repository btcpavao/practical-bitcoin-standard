# Debt And Bitcoin Are Dangerous Combination

Having both debt and Bitcoin on your balance sheet is extremely risky for your net worth management. Staying in debt during Bitcoin bull runs could lead you to FOMO into more debt in order to increase your Bitcoin exposure. Staying in debt during Bitcoin bear markets could lead you to panic and reduce your Bitcoin exposure in order to stay solvent and avoid bankruptcy.&#x20;

The only wise way is to pay off all of your debts first, and then begin accumulating Bitcoin with zero debt on your balance sheet.

## If You Have Debt And Hold Bitcoin, You Risk Losing In Multiple Ways

You may believe that you are profiting from the difference between the interest rate you are paying on debt and the annual growth rate of bitcoin.

However, if you believe this, you are overlooking or forgetting several issues.&#x20;

The first is the opportunity cost of your stress as a result of this action.&#x20;

The second is the increased cost of ownership because you have less money for maintenance of the item you purchased with debt, resulting in a higher real rate of depreciation.&#x20;

And the third is the opportunity cost of not being able to increase the spirit of generosity and income.

Even though your interest rate is a fixed percentage, your perception of the value of the item that you financed may shift over time. When your initial assessment of a product is off, you may end up with something you don't like but are stuck paying for anyway.

You might not stick to your plan if bitcoin gets too volatile. If it rises and you haven't paid off your debt, you may feel compelled to take on even more debt in an effort to "chase the pump." The added pressure of having to keep making payments on an asset you can no longer afford means that you'll be less happy with your possessions than you would be if you didn't have any debt to worry about.

## When You Become Debt-Free, Transition From Fiat To Bitcoin Standard Eases For Everyone

When a commercial bank extends credit, it effectively increases the money supply.

When you pay off a loan or go into default, the money supply decreases.

When you repay your bank loan, you reduce the supply of fiat money, boosting the purchasing power of those who still have fiat in their cash accounts. For everyone else, you raised the interest rate on borrowing, which lowered their desire to do so.

You can do your part to lessen the need for the printing of new fiat money by living debt-free for as long as possible. You being debt-free indirectly increases the cost of borrowing for all borrowers.

People convert their current money to bitcoin (increasing the bitcoin spot price), but they can also convert their credit to bitcoin (leveraged bitcoin buying, going into debt to buy bitcoin, or buying bitcoin while still having debt on the balance sheet).

Credit-funded Bitcoin purchases, however, result in more extreme parabolic price movements, which, when exhausted (when users can no longer take on additional debt), result in even more extreme Bitcoin price crashes due to the liquidation cascade effect.

Without debt, the process of monetising bitcoin would be more stable.

The greater demand you have for holding bitcoin cash balance makes it more valuable, which encourages others to follow suit. If you do this without incurring debt, it becomes even more appealing for lenders to sell their loans and invest in bitcoin instead. If people had less debt, there would be less capital misallocation and less government funding, leading to more free market signal and ultimately more civilization.

### How To Become And Stay Debt-Free?

#### Become Debt-Free

We can usually read and hear about three different debt-reduction strategies.

The first is the debt snowball method, in which you order your debts from smallest to largest and make the minimum payment on all but the smallest, where you pay the most. The goal is to build momentum by paying off small debts first, so you can get "the kick" and be more motivated to pile on the next in line. If you only have a choice between these three methods, I'd go with this one.

The second method is the debt avalanche method, in which you order your debts by the size of their interest rates and pay the minimum on all but the debt with the highest interest rates, where you pay the most. Just mathematically speaking, this will be the quickest way out of debt out of the three. The disadvantage is that it is the most difficult to maintain psychologically.

The third method is debt consolidation, which involves taking on new debt with a single interest rate and duration to pay off all of your existing debts with different maturities and interest rates. This is the easiest, but the main drawback is that you will probably want to choose a longer maturity term for your debt because you will psychologically prefer to have a smaller monthly payment amount. This will keep you in debt for the longest period of time.

My advice is to sell off whatever assets you can and pay off your debt as soon as possible because you will benefit most from spending the least amount of time in debt. This is because, after that, you can proceed to the next phase, which will increase your inflows, by allocating 10% to 20% of your budget to the Giving category.

If you are not convinced about it, I would advise you to continue managing your budget and attempting to make ends meet while retaining your Bitcoin. You can try any of the three mentioned strategies to speed up the process, but ultimately I think the volatility of Bitcoin will eventually force you to decide to simply pay off your debt for good, even if it means big change in your lifestyle.
