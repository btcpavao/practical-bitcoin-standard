# Aging Your Money Increases Spirits Of Freedom, Peace And Clarity

The older your money, the more financial peace you have. Debt reduces the age of money. Higher age of money equals lower time preference.

With a higher age of money, you will enjoy your purchases more because there was more time spent planning, anticipating, and overall appreciation.
