# Debt Effects

## How Your Debt Affects You

Your debt affects your spiritual blueprint. It has an impact on your ability to generate inflows. It has an impact on how you generate outflows.

### Debt Reduces Your Capacity For Generating Inflows And Increases Your Wasteful Outflows

This may be an obvious point, but it should still be stated explicitly. When you spend on credit (or enter a state of debt), you are still spending money; you are not receiving the item for free.

Often, we miss this point because we mistakenly believe that if we purchase something on credit, even if we don't have enough money to pay for it in full, we are going to get it without having to pay for it. However, we will be making payments for it; they will just be spaced out over the length of the debt.

The fact that we have not yet made a single payment for this item, however, gives us the impression that we received it for free. Even when we begin paying for it, we still have the impression that we obtained it without actually paying for it. Do you get what I mean?

Suppose that you have $10,000 in your bank account and make $4,000 per month. You are looking at a new automobile with a price tag of $50,000. You clearly cannot afford it; even if you emptied your entire bank account, you would still be $40,000 short. However, if the cost of this vehicle is presented to you as $650 per month over the next 84 months, you will only compare two numbers: your current monthly income of $4,000 and the monthly outflow of $650 for this car. Suddenly, it appears that you may be able to purchase and begin driving this vehicle. But there is a great deal of confusion here.

Starting out in this massive confusion, you will try to rationalize why you should actually go for it. You will use this car to get to work, your old car is in need of repairs, this new car will be better and more reliable, etc., you will earn more money in the future, and you really want it now.

However, the true calculation for this automobile is as follows: First, if you paid with cash, you would likely receive a price reduction, perhaps between 5 and 10 percent. And if you multiply $650 payments by 84 months, you'll end up paying $54,600 for the car, as opposed to $47,600 (5% discount) or $45,000 (10% discount). We're talking about a $7,000 to $8,600 difference over 84 months. After that, you must determine the opportunity cost of holding onto this difference if it was saved in bitcoin. At the time of writing, if you held $83 difference per month ($7,000 / 84), your purchasing power would increase 450%, resulting in around $36,000 worth of bitcoin, and if you do the same calculation for 10% discount ($102 per month, $8,600 divided by 84 months), you would end up with around $44,000 worth of bitcoin.

You should also calculate the depreciation of the vehicle over the next seven years and understand that the rate will likely be lower if you purchase the vehicle with cash instead of credit. This is due to the fact that, in general, we tend to care for things more when we own them outright, as opposed to gradually gaining partial ownership as the item is used. There is a reason why leased and financed automobiles are typically in poorer condition after being driven by owners who took on debt to acquire them, compared to the same automobiles driven by cash-paying owners who took better care of them throughout their use. The same is true for any other item you purchase with credit.

### Your Outflows Are Increased Because Of Interest, Opportunity Cost & Misallocation

Spending credit is always more expensive than spending cash because humans have a positive time preference, which means they prefer present money to future money. The cost of spending future money is expressed in the interest rate.

The price you pay over the life of the debt has two opportunity cost sources: the amount you would save if you paid for the same item with cash and the total interest you will pay over the life of the debt.

Your opportunity cost should be calculated in terms of the appreciation of purchasing power if the money was saved in bitcoin throughout the duration of the debt.

There is a third, frequently overlooked cost of using credit: the opportunity cost of financial decisions made under the influence of the spirits of slavery, restlessness and confution rather than the spirits of freedom, peace and clarity. For instance, your next 30 years of inflows and outflows, as well as decisions regarding your net worth balance, will look very different and have very different outcomes if you a) have 50% of your net worth in debts and b) you have no debts.

The third cost of spending credit should also be calculated in terms of the appreciation of purchasing power if the money was saved in bitcoin throughout the duration of the debt.

### Your Inflows Are Reduced Because of Lower Risk Tolerance

Your inventory of time is the most valuable asset you have. You take on some level of risk whenever you choose to invest your time in a potential business opportunity; however, you do so with the goal of increasing both the quantity and the quality of your available time.

Risk and return are facets of the same coin.

Even with zero risk and a positive return of X, there is still an opportunity cost associated with taking greater than zero risk and gaining greater than X return. Because of this, there is no real way to avoid taking risks.

There are opportunities, both positive and negative, and both involve taking a risk.

Every claim on your future time (debt) diminishes your ability to take risks with your time.

At a debt-to-assets ratio of 100 percent, all of your time is spent servicing debt, and you cannot afford to take any risks with your time.

This is where you begin to incur significant opportunity costs, because there will be risks greater than zero that will yield a higher return than what you have, but you cannot take them.

### Debt Decreases Your Ownership Satisfaction

The time you put into working to save for something increases your satisfaction with the item when you buy it.

This is because we care about the things we invest in. Our time investment in something makes it more valuable to us.

Consider the following scenario: you buy a car after saving for it for seven years. You were carefully setting aside a portion of your income for this savings goal over the course of these seven years, and you also had time to learn everything you could about the car and alternatives.

The fact that you waited seven years to buy this car will make it more enjoyable and make you feel like you've upgraded from whatever you were driving before you bought it.

You were able to research everything about it because of the time it took you to save up for it.

You were able to get a price reduction by paying cash.

Additionally, when you began using it, you took care of it by assigning enough money to cover the cost of ownership.

All of this influenced the overall ownership experience.

Now compare this to a situation in which you buy the car on credit now and pay it off over the next 7 years.

First and foremost, you will not have the sense of building up to the purchase of the car, the anticipation and time you put into saving for it. This is going to give you a completely different feeling than if you saved up for it.

However, once you begin using the car, you begin paying for it and investing your time in it. Now the feeling of liking the car increases because you are working for it and paying for it in installments, but it is offset by the feeling of discovering some flaws in the car that you didn't have time to research and investigate because you jumped into debt quickly before hand.

You also don't have a full sense of ownership yet, so you don't take good care of the car. This simply raises the cost of ownership in terms of the depreciation curve, and you begin to avoid looking into the actual market value of the car in relation to your overall debt balance for it (it may already be underwater).

After a while, you end up with a car that is gradually becoming a burden rather than a joy.

### Debt Increases Your Cost Of Ownership

We take better care of things we own outright.

Taking less care of a debt-purchased item means deferring maintenance costs into the future, which will only increase them later.

Because of this effect, the depreciation curve on something you bought with debt will be steeper than the one you own outright and properly maintain in the best condition possible.

Even worse, you don't really feel like you own the thing for the duration of the debt, but when you finally pay it off, it has depreciated so much that owning it doesn't feel as good as it would if you bought it with savings.

## How Your Debt Affects Others

If you incur debt through the creation of fiat money, it affects others who are forced by the state to hold fiat debt instruments.

### Your Debt Steals Purchasing Power From The Poor

When you take out a bank loan, you create new fiat money.

Fiat money ceases to exist when you repay the loan or default on it.

The only reason this system works is because of the state's violent coercion, which mandates the use of fiat money in the marketplace through legal tender laws, tax collection in fiat money, and mandates that large financial institutions hold a certain amount of government bonds in their portfolios.

This effectively means that the only reason debt is monetized globally is due to state coercion.

Thus, when you incur debt through any of the fiat-licensed institutions, you effectively leverage the state's coercive power to transfer your credit risk to the fiat-money holders.

Your credit risk will eventually manifest as widespread price inflation.

Inflation is the most regressive form of taxation because it disproportionately affects the poor. Poor people have the majority of their net worth in liquid fiat cash, whereas wealthy people have only a small portion of their net worth in liquid cash.

### Your Debt Generates Economic Distortions

* real estate monetization
* capital misallocation
* business boom & bust cycles
* price signal distortion
* worsens economic calculation
