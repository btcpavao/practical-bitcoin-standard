# Never Spend From The Uncertainty Of The Future

Why is it never a good idea to use credit or get into debt? Fundamentally, because the future is uncertain.

Let's think more deeply about it. What does it mean that the future is uncertain? This simply means that we do not know what will happen in our lives tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, or in ten years. We can plan for and expect some events to happen, but there is no way to know with certainty.

When one considers uncertainty about the future, they typically associate it with fear of negative outcomes. However, an uncertain future also implies the possibility of positive outcomes. We simply don't know what will happen, when, or how (both good and bad).

This is why it is fundamentally unwise to spend your future money. Simply said, you have no knowledge how much money you will earn or have in the future.

On the other hand, we know for certain what will happen if you spend from the future. Until you pay off the debt, your present cash outflows will increase.

This increase in your present cash outflows can be a problem in two different ways.

A negative event that might happen in the future (which, once again, you are unaware of) such as losing your job or seeing a decline in your cash inflows as a result of any unfavorable circumstance (losing the job, your clients filing for bankruptcy, getting sick, etc.). A reduction in income will make your debt situation worse since you run a higher risk of defaulting on your debt, which typically has a domino effect of negative consequences. Did you know that financial issues, primarily stemming from debt, account for the majority of divorces?

You might eventually come across a good opportunity that you regretfully miss out on because you are unable to take calculated risks with your income. For example, you may come across an opportunity to switch careers or start a new business. Both of these things could reduce or stop your income for a while (let's say for a year or two), but after this decrease, your income could double, triple, or grow by orders of magnitude more than what you make now. However, you are incurring this opportunity cost because you simply cannot afford to take the risk - because your cash outflows are already determined by the payments you must make.

Furthermore, each time you conduct a transaction, you are performing valuation in the here and now, and that valuation may alter later on. The item you are purchasing now may be more valuable to you than the money you must exchange to obtain it, whereas the same item may be less valuable to you than the money you must exchange for it in the future. Your subjective valuation can and will change due to a variety of factors, none of which you can predict with certainty.
