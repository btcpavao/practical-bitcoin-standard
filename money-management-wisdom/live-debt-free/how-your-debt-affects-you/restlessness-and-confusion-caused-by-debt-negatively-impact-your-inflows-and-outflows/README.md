# Debt Reduces Your Capacity For Generating Inflows And Increases Your Wasteful Outflows

This may be an obvious point, but it should still be stated explicitly. When you spend on credit (or enter a state of debt), you are still spending money; you are not receiving the item for free.

Often, we miss this point because we mistakenly believe that if we purchase something on credit, even if we don't have enough money to pay for it in full, we are going to get it without having to pay for it. However, we will be making payments for it; they will just be spaced out over the length of the debt.

The fact that we have not yet made a single payment for this item, however, gives us the impression that we received it for free. Even when we begin paying for it, we still have the impression that we obtained it without actually paying for it. Do you get what I mean?

Suppose that you have $10,000 in your bank account and make $4,000 per month. You are looking at a new automobile with a price tag of $50,000. You clearly cannot afford it; even if you emptied your entire bank account, you would still be $40,000 short. However, if the cost of this vehicle is presented to you as $650 per month over the next 84 months, you will only compare two numbers: your current monthly income of $4,000 and the monthly outflow of $650 for this car. Suddenly, it appears that you may be able to purchase and begin driving this vehicle. But there is a great deal of confusion here.

Starting out in this massive confusion, you will try to rationalize why you should actually go for it. You will use this car to get to work, your old car is in need of repairs, this new car will be better and more reliable, etc., you will earn more money in the future, and you really want it now.

However, the true calculation for this automobile is as follows: First, if you paid with cash, you would likely receive a price reduction, perhaps between 5 and 10 percent. And if you multiply $650 payments by 84 months, you'll end up paying $54,600 for the car, as opposed to $47,600 (5% discount) or $45,000 (10% discount). We're talking about a $7,000 to $8,600 difference over 84 months. After that, you must determine the opportunity cost of holding onto this difference if it was saved in bitcoin. At the time of writing, if you held $83 difference per month ($7,000 / 84), your purchasing power would increase 450%, resulting in around $36,000 worth of bitcoin, and if you do the same calculation for 10% discount ($102 per month, $8,600 divided by 84 months), you would end up with around $44,000 worth of bitcoin.

You should also calculate the depreciation of the vehicle over the next seven years and understand that the rate will likely be lower if you purchase the vehicle with cash instead of credit. This is due to the fact that, in general, we tend to care for things more when we own them outright, as opposed to gradually gaining partial ownership as the item is used. There is a reason why leased and financed automobiles are typically in poorer condition after being driven by owners who took on debt to acquire them, compared to the same automobiles driven by cash-paying owners who took better care of them throughout their use. The same is true for any other item you purchase with credit.
