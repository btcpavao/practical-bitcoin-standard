# Inflows Are Reduced Because of Lower Risk Tolerance

Your inventory of time is the most valuable asset you have. You take on some level of risk whenever you choose to invest your time in a potential business opportunity; however, you do so with the goal of increasing both the quantity and the quality of your available time.

Risk and return are facets of the same coin.

Even with zero risk and a positive return of X, there is still an opportunity cost associated with taking greater than zero risk and gaining greater than X return. Because of this, there is no real way to avoid taking risks.

There are opportunities, both positive and negative, and both involve taking a risk.

Every claim on your future time (debt) diminishes your ability to take risks with your time.

At a debt-to-assets ratio of 100 percent, all of your time is spent servicing debt, and you cannot afford to take any risks with your time.

This is where you begin to incur significant opportunity costs, because there will be risks greater than zero that will yield a higher return than what you have, but you cannot take them.
