# Your Money Exists In The Past And In The Future

## Never Spend Your Future Money

Why is it never a good idea to use credit or get into debt? Fundamentally, because the future is uncertain.

Let's think more deeply about it. What does it mean that the future is uncertain? This simply means that we do not know what will happen in our lives tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, or in ten years. We can plan for and expect some events to happen, but there is no way to know with certainty.

When one considers uncertainty about the future, they typically associate it with fear of negative outcomes. However, an uncertain future also implies the possibility of positive outcomes. We simply don't know what will happen, when, or how (both good and bad).

This is why it is fundamentally unwise to spend your future money. Simply said, you have no knowledge how much money you will earn or have in the future.

On the other hand, we know for certain what will happen if you spend from the future. Until you pay off the debt, your present cash outflows will increase.

This increase in your present cash outflows can be a problem in two different ways.

A negative event that might happen in the future (which, once again, you are unaware of) such as losing your job or seeing a decline in your cash inflows as a result of any unfavorable circumstance (losing the job, your clients filing for bankruptcy, getting sick, etc.). A reduction in income will make your debt situation worse since you run a higher risk of defaulting on your debt, which typically has a domino effect of negative consequences. Did you know that financial issues, primarily stemming from debt, account for the majority of divorces?

You might eventually come across a good opportunity that you regretfully miss out on because you are unable to take calculated risks with your income. For example, you may come across an opportunity to switch careers or start a new business. Both of these things could reduce or stop your income for a while (let's say for a year or two), but after this decrease, your income could double, triple, or grow by orders of magnitude more than what you make now. However, you are incurring this opportunity cost because you simply cannot afford to take the risk - because your cash outflows are already determined by the payments you must make.

Furthermore, each time you conduct a transaction, you are performing valuation in the here and now, and that valuation may alter later on. The item you are purchasing now may be more valuable to you than the money you must exchange to obtain it, whereas the same item may be less valuable to you than the money you must exchange for it in the future. Your subjective valuation can and will change due to a variety of factors, none of which you can predict with certainty.

## Always Spend Your Past Money

Spending money you already have means you are fully aware of its opportunity cost (because your money is already budgeted).

You will always receive a better deal when paying with cash for whatever you are purchasing than when using credit, and you will avoid paying the interest rate over time. When you add up these two, you should consider their future purchasing power if you were to save them in Bitcoin.

For instance, if you see something with a $5,000 manufacturerâ€™s suggested retail price (MSRP, or sticker price) and decide to buy it with cash, you may be able to negotiate the price down to around $4,500. If, on the other hand, you were to finance it over, say, five years, you would pay about $6,000 total, or $100 a month. But the $1,500 price difference should be adjusted for it's opportunity cost if it were saved in Bitcoin over 5 years. We are still talking about an annual compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 15%, even if we assume that Bitcoin will continue to grow at a rate ten times slower than its historical trend.

And this is without even considering the value of your potential to increase your inflows as a result of not growing a spirit of slavery, restlessness, and confusion, but rather a spirit of freedom, peace, and clarity over the time you'd otherwise be in debt.
