# How To Stay Debt-Free?

* never use credit cards
* never borrow money under any circumstance
* only spend from the past
* have at least a third of your net worth in cash balance (high liquidity / salability) -> read about it later in Wisdom For Your Net Worth
* whenever you get the bill, pay it immidiately, the same day you get it
* have at least 3 to 6 months of your regular expenses in savings before you decide to purchase something outside of that
* never try to collect airline miles or fall for cashback offers by credit cards
* never try to get "deals" by making payments instead of purchasing the thing outright
* never fall for foolish idea that "there is good debt and bad debt". all debt will have same spiritual consequences which you want to avoid at all costs
