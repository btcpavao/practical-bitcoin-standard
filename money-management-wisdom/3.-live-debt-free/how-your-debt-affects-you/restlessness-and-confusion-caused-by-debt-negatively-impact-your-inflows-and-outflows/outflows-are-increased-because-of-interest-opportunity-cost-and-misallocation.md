# Outflows Are Increased Because Of Interest, Opportunity Cost & Misallocation

Spending credit is always more expensive than spending cash because humans have a positive time preference, which means they prefer present money to future money. The cost of spending future money is expressed in the interest rate.

The price you pay over the life of the debt has two opportunity cost sources: the amount you would save if you paid for the same item with cash and the total interest you will pay over the life of the debt.

Your opportunity cost should be calculated in terms of the appreciation of purchasing power if the money was saved in bitcoin throughout the duration of the debt.

There is a third, frequently overlooked cost of using credit: the opportunity cost of financial decisions made under the influence of the spirits of slavery, restlessness and confution rather than the spirits of freedom, peace and clarity. For instance, your next 30 years of inflows and outflows, as well as decisions regarding your net worth balance, will look very different and have very different outcomes if you a) have 50% of your net worth in debts and b) you have no debts.

The third cost of spending credit should also be calculated in terms of the appreciation of purchasing power if the money was saved in bitcoin throughout the duration of the debt.&#x20;
