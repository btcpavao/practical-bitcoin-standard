# Your Debt Steals Purchasing Power From The Poor

When you take out a bank loan, you create new fiat money.

Fiat money ceases to exist when you repay the loan or default on it.

The only reason this system works is because of the state's violent coercion, which mandates the use of fiat money in the marketplace through legal tender laws, tax collection in fiat money, and mandates that large financial institutions hold a certain amount of government bonds in their portfolios.

This effectively means that the only reason debt is monetized globally is due to state coercion.

Thus, when you incur debt through any of the fiat-licensed institutions, you effectively leverage the state's coercive power to transfer your credit risk to the fiat-money holders.

Your credit risk will eventually manifest as widespread price inflation.

Inflation is the most regressive form of taxation because it disproportionately affects the poor. Poor people have the majority of their net worth in liquid fiat cash, whereas wealthy people have only a small portion of their net worth in liquid cash.
