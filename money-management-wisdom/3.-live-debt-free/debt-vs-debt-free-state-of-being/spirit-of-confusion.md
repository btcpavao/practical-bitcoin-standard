# Spirit of Confusion

The main cause of the spirit of confusion is your choice to spend money from the uncertain future.

Humans can only make valuations in the present, and they can be informed by the certainty of their previous valuations.

When you spend from the future, you get confused about the value of what you bought. This is because you performed present valuation on the present thing you bought, but did so with future money. But in the future, your valuation can change completely.

Confusion raises the cost of ownership of the item you purchased because you are less likely to properly care for it. You are not properly caring for it because it is not truly yours until you pay it off.

Nevertheless, your valuation of the thing may change during the payoff period, and you may value the money you are paying for it more than the thing itself.

However, if you try to liquidate the thing and pay off the debt, you may find that the depreciation of the thing, combined with your reduced ongoing maintenance costs, increased the cost of ownership so much that you are unable to pay off the debt completely by simply liquidating the thing. In other words, you are "underwater," as the asset you are attempting to liquidate is worth less than your debt.

The spirit of confusion will make it more difficult for you to realistically mark to market the value of the item you purchased with debt. Because you know that just looking at it will make things more confusing, you won't want to.
