# Plan Your Money

* [ ] screencast tutorials

<!---->

* the first and most important principle is to always have a plan for all of your money, before you spend any of it
* this is not just do-it-once activity, rather, it's a continuous process of planning and adjusting the plan as you go. the practice is called zero-based budgeting.
* why? because we want to make decisions about our money deliberately, before we actually spend it
* we'll understand the concept of opportunity cost of our money by using budget categories and assigning our money to them
* we'll learn the relationship between time and money, and start tracking our age of money
* we'll learn how our money behaves in time and across categories
* we'll use our past transaction data better plan our budget
* the longer we keep our budget updated, the further away in the future we can plan
* our spending decisions in the present will always be decided beforehand
* it's one of three necessary steps before we upgrade to full Bitcoin standard, i.e. use Bitcoin as our primary money
