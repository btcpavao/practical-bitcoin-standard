# Always Plan Your Money

* why? because we want to make decisions about our money deliberately, before we actually spend it
* this is the first step you should take
* we'll do this through the practice of zero based budgeting, which will be explained in detail
* we'll understand the concept of opportunity cost of our money, and internalize it by practicing zero-based budgeting
* we'll learn the relationship between time and money, and internalize it by practicing zero-based budgeting
* we'll learn to manage money in time dimension: we'll use our past money data to inform our plan for the future. the longer we keep our budget updated, the further away in the future we can plan
* our spending decisions in the present will always be decided beforehand
* it's the first fundamental practice that will allow us to manage changes in our purchasing power
* it's a preparation for starting to use Bitcoin as your primary money
