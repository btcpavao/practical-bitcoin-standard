# Mission: 180 Days Of Budgeting Practice

Start by setting up your budget according to the instructions provided in the previous chapter. Then, make sure to keep track of all your inflows and outflows for a continuous period of 180 days. After this six-month period, you should be prepared to answer the following questions:

* What is your age of money?
* What was your net worth three months ago, including both your assets and liabilities?
* How much did you spend on groceries four months ago?
* What was your average net income in the past six months?
* What was your net income two months ago?
* Which category comprises the largest percentage of your spending, and what is that percentage?
* What was your average monthly spending in the past six months?
* What was your total spending in the past six months?
