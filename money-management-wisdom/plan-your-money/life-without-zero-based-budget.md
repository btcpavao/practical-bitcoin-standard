# Why Practice Budgeting?

One of the major misconceptions about budgeting is the belief that it solely involves reducing spending or tracking expenses. In reality, budgeting is about allocating our money, giving it a specific plan or purpose before we spend it. "Planning" might be a more accurate term, or even "economizing." Also, budgeting is a process of managing money, it's not a particular destination we arrive at and stay there.

This manual will focus specifically on the practice of zero-based budgeting. When used in this context, "zero-based" means that we assign all of our money to each budget category until there is no more money to be assigned. For example, if we have $1,000 in our budget and only assign $200 to a category, we still have $800 to assign. The budget is not zero-based until we decide how to assign the remaining $800 (to which category/categories).

So why bother doing this?

If you never practiced budgeting, chances are you have some level of disorder in your financial life. So our first objective is to bring this aspect of your life into perfect order, and it's entirely achievable, regardless of the current state of disorder. In fact, it's quite straightforward.

The moment you establish your budget for the first time (which typically doesn't require more than an afternoon, at most), you'll experience a noticeable shift in your sense of control over your finances. People often report feeling like they've received a substantial raise after creating their first budget.

Every subsequent transaction you record in your budget maintains this perfect order and sense of being in control over your money. However, if you neglect to record a transaction, or stop maintaining your budget altogether, you initiate a process of entropy, which gradually brings disorder back into your financial life.

The good news is that when you return and start fresh once again, recreate your budget, perfect order is instantly restored. Afterward, you simply need to sustain it by promptly entering transactions into your budget as you make them, and keep it up to date & balanced.&#x20;

As time goes on, you'll discover that there is a natural ebb and flow to this process. You may find yourself becoming increasingly irritated when you slip up and reintroduce disorder into your financial life. You will realize that you can uphold perfect order in this area with just a few minutes of attention each day, and the more time you invest in fine-tuning your budget, the wiser your financial decisions will become.

At some point, you won't want to go back to disorder.

Without budgeting, our money management tends to be guided by emotions rather than rational decision-making. Some of us become overly frugal with our spending, while others become too lenient, and we might say, sloppy.&#x20;

This is because without a budget, we lack clarity regarding the opportunity cost and time dimension of our money. So, when making spending decisions, we typically compare the immediate transaction amount with our approximate total available funds.

Consequently, our decision-making hinges on our feelings in the moment, often leading to post-purchase regrets. When we start budgeting, this sense of regret dissapears.

Without budgeting, it's challenging to recall how we've been spending our money, apart from having a vague idea, and only for a short period. There's a general sense of uncertainty about our spending habits. Our lack of historical spending data hinders our ability to plan for future expenditures.&#x20;

When we adopt budgeting, we gain a precise understanding of when, how much, on what, and where we spend our money. As we accumulate this data, we grow better equipped to better plan our financial future.

Before budgeting, many of us are apprehensive about delving deep into our money situation, because we are uncertain how we'll feel. We want to avoid feeling bad about our money situation. However, once we start budgeting, we'll find the practice increasingly enjoyable on a daily basis.

Some common challenges and bad habits we get when not practicing budgeting include:

1. Living paycheck to paycheck.
2. Falling for messages promoting debt.
3. Believing we couldn't afford certain things without debt.
4. Underestimating the emotional toll of handling money unwisely.
5. Lacking a sense of control over our money.
6. Having a generally higher time preference (preferring immediate rewards over delayed gratification).
7. Not understanding the concept of opportunity cost.
8. Not understanding time dimension of money.

The more we practice budgeting, the better we'll become at it. There is no set time limit for when we ought to stop practicing it because if we continue for ten years, we will have refined our skills and will be able to make accurate plans for the next ten years.

### Categorize Your Money To Define Its Opportunity Cost

In order to gain full control over our money, we first have to decide it's opportunity cost. Without budgeting, our money opportunity cost remains undecided. Let's illustrate this through an example story.

Imagine we have $5,000 in our bank account, which is all the money we have at the moment. Should we go to a nice restaurant that has an average dinner price of about $100 if we really want to?

Without zero-based budgeting in place, our decision-making process is as follows: we look at our bank account, see $5,000, and may think, "Well, $5,000 is much more than $100, so we can afford this," and then go out to eat.

In our example, sitting down to a $100 dinner means we gave up $100 worth of alternatives on something we hadn't decided on before. In other words, because we spent $100 on dinner, we are unable to spend the same amount on something else. Even though this may seem like a simple idea, it can be difficult to fully understand what it means without first assigning money in our budget.

Returning to our previous example of having $5,000 in our bank account, suppose we made a zero-based budget one afternoon couple of weeks before we came across the restaurant. In this case, we put a fifth of our $5,000, or $1,000, into the Giving category of our budget. We'll talk more about this in later chapters.

A further fifth of our budget, or $1,000, was assigned to cover our housing expenses (rent, utilities, upkeep, etc.). We set aside $1,000 for groceries, $1,000 for transportation, and $1,000 for "Everything Else" (which could include things like clothing, hobbies, travel, dining out, etc.). We could further subdivide these categories, but let's keep it simple for now.

When deciding whether to spend $100 on dinner right now, we are not looking at the total amount of money in our bank account ($5,000), but rather at our "Everything Else" category, which has $1,000 available.

Here is how our budget looks like:

Total Budget: $5,000

Giving: $1,000

Shelter: $1,000

Groceries: $1,000

Transport: $1,000

Everything Else: $1,000

We now know that if we spend $100 on this dinner, we will have $900 left in the "Everything Else" category. We decide that we value the dinner experience more than retaining $1,000 in the Everything Else category, and we enjoy it. Additionally, we give the waiter a $20 tip, which we subtract from the Giving category, bringing it down from $1,000 to $980.

The remaining amount in our overall budget is $4,880. Here is how it looks now:

Total Budget: $5,000 -> $4,880

Giving: $1,000 -> $980

Shelter: $1,000

Groceries: $1,000

Transport: $1,000

Everything Else: $1,000 -> $900

We decided to adherre to one of the three timeless money management principles, and always keep 20% of our total budget in the Giving category (again, more on this later). This means we should have $976 instead of $980 in the Giving category. So, we decide to move $4 from "Giving" to another budget category, like "Everything Else." This means that our budget now looks like this:

Total Budget: $4,880

Giving: $980 -> $976

Shelter: $1,000

Groceries: $1,000

Transport: $1,000

Everything Else: $900 -> $904

Imagine that one day after dinner, on the way to work, we stop at a gas station, fill up the tank, and pay $65 to do so. We deduct it from the Transport category, bringing it's amount down from $1,000 to $935. Our total budget is now $4,815.

Total Budget: $4,880 -> $4,815

Giving: $976

Shelter: $1,000

Groceries: $1,000

Transport: $1,000 -> $935

Everything Else: $904

We again apply timeless principle of keeping our Giving category at 20% of total budget, so we transfer $13 from Giving back to Transportation, resulting in the following budget breakdown:

Total Budget: $4,815

Giving: $976 -> $963

Shelter: $1,000

Groceries: $1,000

Transport: $935 -> $948

Everything Else: $904

Now imagine that a few days later, we spend $50 on a birthday present for a friend. We deduct $50 from the Giving category, bringing it down from $963 to $913, leaving us with a total budget of $4,765.&#x20;

Total Budget: $4,815 -> $4,765

Giving: $963 -> $913

Shelter: $1,000

Groceries: $1,000

Transport: $948

Everything Else: $904

Once more, apply timeless money management principle of keeping 20% of our total budget ($4,765) in the Giving category ($953), so we move $40 from another category, this time Groceries, to Giving. We arrive at the following budget breakdown:

Total Budget: $4,765

Giving: $913 ->$953

Shelter: $1,000

Groceries: $1000 -> $960

Transport: $948

Everything Else: $904

Then, we the day arrives when we usually pay for our rent and utilities like mobile phone bill. Our rent is $400, our mobile phone bill is $25. Let's also imagine we do our weekly groceries shopping, and spend $120 at the grocery store. Our budget now looks like this:

Total Budget: $4,765 -> $4,220

Giving: $953

Shelter: $1000 -> $600

Groceries: $960 -> $840

Transport: $948

Everything Else: $904 -> $879

Again, we calculate that our Giving category should be at 20% of total budget, which is $844 instead of $953. We move $109 from Giving to Shelter, and also decide to move $100 from Transport to Shelter, so everything is a bit more balanced. Our budget now looks like this:

Total Budget: $4,220

Giving: $953 -> $844

Shelter: $600 -> $809

Groceries: $840

Transport: $948 -> $848

Everything Else: $879

And now, let's imagine couple of days after, we get our $1,500 paycheck:

Total Budget: $4,220 -> $5,220

Giving: $844

Shelter: $809

Groceries: $840

Transport: $848

Everything Else: $879

We know we should be at 20% of the budget in Giving ($1,044), and we decide to top up the rest of the categories as well. We end up with this:

Total Budget: $5,220

Giving: $844 -> $1,044

Shelter: $809 - >$1,106

Groceries: $840 -> $1,020

Transport: $848 -> $1,020

Everything Else: $879 -> $1,030

### Budgeting Allows You To See Your Money's Time Dimension

The total amount of money we have can be viewed through the lens of time.

We have money in the present that we earned in the past.

We own money in the future that we have not yet earned.

We can choose to transact in the present with money that we have already earned in the past or with money that we have not yet earned in the future.

We know with absolute certainty how much money we have made in the past.

The money that we have yet to earn in the future is completely uncertain.

This is due to the fact that we can never be certain of how much time we have left to live and earn money because of the nature of time. As a result, we can never predict how much money we will have in the future.

When we look at our current money situation, it's like looking at a still photo, a snapshot. We know how much money we have right now.&#x20;

However, our money exists in a continuous flow of time, and we have to get used to looking at it through that lens as well. We can only gain this perspective by practicing budgeting over some amount of time. If we keep doing it for a few months for example, we'll start to see our money situation more similar to a video than a snapshot.

As we do this, we naturally begin using past budgeting information to adjust our budget to better fit our future plans & goals. The longer we practice budgeting, the further ahead we can look and plan. We'll start tracking our "age of money" to see how it changes based on how much we put into each category and when we spend it. We'll learn how to increase this number, which will give us more financial peace and clarity.

We'll also learn how to use savings goals. For example, if we want to save $20,000 for a car and we already have $2,000 in our Transport category, we can set a goal to save $20,000. Then, our $2,000 in the Transportation category means we're 10% closer to our savings goal. We can also contextualize our goals in dimension of time. In this example, if we want to reach our $20,000 target in the next two years, we will realize that we have to assign $750 in Transportation category each month for the next 24 months to get there.
