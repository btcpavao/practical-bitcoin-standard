# Inflows & Outflows

Inflow refers to money coming in.&#x20;

Outflow refers to money going out.&#x20;

Our inflow and outflow levels can be compared over time.&#x20;

If more money comes in than goes out, you will have a positive net income. When outflows are higher than inflows, you have negative net income.&#x20;

Your average net income is calculated over time.&#x20;

Task: Check your income and expenses once a week. Take a look at your net income. Limit your search to a single category.
