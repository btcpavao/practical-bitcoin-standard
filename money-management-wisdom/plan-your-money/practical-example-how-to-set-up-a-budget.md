# How To Make A Zero Based Budget

You can create a zero-based budget by just using pen and paper, or zero-budgeting software (I recommend [YNAB](https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=uG2RTVYBHGoOcJ8K)).&#x20;

Here's a step-by-step guide:

**Pen and Paper Method:**

* Start with a simple thought exercise. You have $100 in total, so you want to assign amounts to three different categories.&#x20;
* For example, "I have $100, so I'm going to assign $30 to Category 1, $40 to Category 2, and $30 to Category 3."
* Imagine spending $10 from one of the categories. Let's say you spend $10 from Category 2. You are now left with a total of $90.
* Adjust the category balance. In this case, update Category 2 to show that you have $40 - $10 = $30 remaining in that category.
* Repeat this process for any further expenses or income adjustments.
* This method allows you to manually track and adjust your budget using pen and paper.

**Using** [**YNAB**](https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=uG2RTVYBHGoOcJ8K)**:**

* Start by counting all the money you have right now, including cash, checking accounts, savings accounts...
* Write down or enter these amounts into [YNAB](https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=uG2RTVYBHGoOcJ8K). For example, if you have $34 in your wallet, add account with a name "Wallet" and enter $34 as your current account balance.
* If you have, as an example, $2,344.42 in your checking account, add account with a name "Checking account" and enter $2,344.42 as your current account balance.
* Proceed with adding any other accounts you can think of, where you have some money.
* [YNAB](https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=uG2RTVYBHGoOcJ8K) will automatically add up all the balances from your various checking and savings accounts, and will show you total amount of money you have ready to assign.
* Now, you need to assign this money to categories. Start by deleting all the template categories you have in [YNAB](https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=uG2RTVYBHGoOcJ8K), and create couple of categories on your own.
* Assign money to these categories, until everything is assigned.
* For assets and liabilities that are not part of your cash balance, list them separately to track your net worth. These can include things like the value of your home (asset) and any outstanding loans (liabilities). Do this by adding tracking accounts.
