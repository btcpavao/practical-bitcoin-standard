# Two States Of Being (In Debt And Debt-Free) Generate Different Spirits

Spending credit taints a person's psychospiritual makeup with the spirits of slavery, restlesness and confusion.&#x20;

You can be either "In Debt" or "Debt Free" in your spiritual makeup. They both cultivate the growth of different spirits: when you are in debt, you cultivate the spirit of slavery, restlesness and confusion, and when you are debt-free, you cultivate the spirit of freedom, peace and clarity.

There is no such thing as "good" or "bad" debt, but there is a specific psychospiritual mechanism that one state cultivates over the other. It may be helpful to imagine your soul as a soil, with seeds of various spirits inside that are kind of laying there, dormant. When a seed is watered (in this metaphor, watering the seed is analogous to a specific practice), it sprouts and begins to grow.

If you keep watering it, it will get bigger, stronger, grow roots and a trunk, and eventually produce fruit.

When you owe money (i.e. have a liability on your balance sheet), you begin to "water" the seed of the spirit of slavery, restlesness and confusion.

When you have no liabilities, that is, you owe no money to anyone, you begin to "water" the spirit of freedom, peace and clarity.
