# Spirit of Clarity

Spirit of clarity manifests as a heightened awareness of the value of each purchase you make, for you. If you consider its value for you is greater than the expense, you will choose to buy it. if not, you won’t.

As your spirit of clarity grows over time, you will continue gaining a more heightened awareness of the value of your purchases for you.

The spirit of clarity will help you keep tabs on your belongings. Once you value an item less than the money it can sell for, you’ll choose to sell it. This will help you keep fine-tuning your net worth composition.
