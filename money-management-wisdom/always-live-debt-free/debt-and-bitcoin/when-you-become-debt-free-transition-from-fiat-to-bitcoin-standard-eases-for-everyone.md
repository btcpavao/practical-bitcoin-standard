# When You Become Debt-Free, Transition From Fiat To Bitcoin Standard Eases For Everyone

When a commercial bank extends credit, it effectively increases the money supply.

When you pay off a loan or go into default, the money supply decreases.

When you repay your bank loan, you reduce the supply of fiat money, boosting the purchasing power of those who still have fiat in their cash accounts. For everyone else, you raised the interest rate on borrowing, which lowered their desire to do so.

You can do your part to lessen the need for the printing of new fiat money by living debt-free for as long as possible. You being debt-free indirectly increases the cost of borrowing for all borrowers.

People convert their current money to bitcoin (increasing the bitcoin spot price), but they can also convert their credit to bitcoin (leveraged bitcoin buying, going into debt to buy bitcoin, or buying bitcoin while still having debt on the balance sheet).

Credit-funded Bitcoin purchases, however, result in more extreme parabolic price movements, which, when exhausted (when users can no longer take on additional debt), result in even more extreme Bitcoin price crashes due to the liquidation cascade effect.

Without debt, the process of monetising bitcoin would be more stable.

The greater demand you have for holding bitcoin cash balance makes it more valuable, which encourages others to follow suit. If you do this without incurring debt, it becomes even more appealing for lenders to sell their loans and invest in bitcoin instead. If people had less debt, there would be less capital misallocation and less government funding, leading to more free market signal and ultimately more civilization.
