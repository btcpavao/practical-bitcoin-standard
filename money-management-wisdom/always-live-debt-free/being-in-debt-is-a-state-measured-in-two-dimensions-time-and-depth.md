# Being In Debt Is A State Measured In Two Dimensions: Time And Depth

When you are in debt, there are two factors that determine the level of slavery your spirit will develop. The first and most significant factor is the length of time spent in debt. This period is measured from the moment that you incurred debt to the moment you became debt-free. For instance, you could be in debt for seven days, seven months, or seven years. The longer one remains in debt, the deeper the spirit of slavery becomes rooted.

The second dimension of debt is the depth of your debt, which is the ratio between the value of your assets and liabilities. If you have $100,000 in assets and $80,000 in debt, you are 80% in debt. If your liabilities exceed the value of your assets, such as if you have $100,000 in assets but $150,000 in debt, you have negative net worth.

It is essentially impossible to completely avoid incurring debt because, even without entering into a formal debt contract with a lender, you generate liabilities during normal financial transactions. For instance, when you visit a restaurant, you typically consume the meal first and pay afterward. If you begin your meal at 7 p.m., finish it at 9 p.m., and then wait one hour to pay the bill, you are responsible for paying for one hour. It is preferable to pay when you finish your dinner at 9 p.m. and settle the bill immediately.

Likewise, when your regular bills arrive, get into a habit of paying them off immidiately, rather than waiting to do it. Let's say you receive the bill for last month's electricity usage on the first of the following month, with a due date of the 15th. Do not delay making the payment until the 15th; instead, make the payment immediately on the 1st. Always return to the first principle stated above: the time spent in debt breeds the spirit of slavery. Eventually, you will not want to delay paying off your debts for any longer than absolutely necessary.
