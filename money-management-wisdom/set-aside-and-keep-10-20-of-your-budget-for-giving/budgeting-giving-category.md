# Giving In Your Budget

I recommend naming one category in your budget "Giving" and keeping it at 10% to 20% of your current budgeting amount (cash balance).

For example, if you have $10,000 in cash, you should allocate $1,000 to $2,000 to the Giving category.

When you spend from your Giving category, for example, if you buy a $100 gift, you should subtract that from your Giving category, which means it will be $900 or $1,900.

However, when you make transactions from other categories, you should rebalance the amount you assign to Giving, because Giving should always be 10% to 20% of your cash balance.

So, if you pay your rent and utilities for the month (say, $600) after purchasing the gift, your total cash balance drops from $10,000 to $9,300 ($100 from Giving and $600 from Shelter). This means that your new Giving category target should be 10% to 20% of $9,300, or between $930 and $1,860.

You will notice that by calculating your Giving category in this manner, you cannot completely deplete it unless you spend all of your money at the same time. This is deliberate, because your giving budget must always be available to you and must adjust in accordance with your current cash balance.

For example, say I start with $10,000 in money (Bitcoin) and allocate $2000 to giving. If Bitcoin falls 50% in purchasing power, and I do not let my $2000 in giving decrease, I'd have $3000 left in the rest of the budget. That means my giving would account for 40% of total budget, which is too much.

But to make it more interesting, say my total net worth may still be around $200k because I may own a $195k house (so $195k in house and $5k in money -> Bitcoin). But in this case, regardless of me keeping 40% of my budget in Giving category, when I make transactions from it, they won’t really affect the growth of the spirit of generosity because my giving budget is still only 1/100th of my total net worth and should be at least 1/60th.

At the end of the day, I believe that money is ultimately not mine; rather, it belongs to God. I only manage and steward it. To properly manage it, I must approach it with balance, keeping at least a third of my net worth in money and a tenth to a fifth of money in Giving at all times.

So in the example above, the proper course of action for me would be to sell $195k house, and then allocate between $20k and $40k to giving in my budget. If I wanted to buy and own a house I’d live in, I could only buy something up to $66k in price (1/3rd of $200k net worth). Then, I’d be left with $134k in money, so my giving budget would be between $13,4k and $26,8k. If I wanted to buy some capital assets, I’d buy up to $66k worth of it, which would leave me with $68k in money. In that case, I would have between $6,8k and $13,6k in giving.

In this situation, if I wanted to increase my inflows, I'd be more inclined to rent rather than own, simply to keep more of my net worth in money (Bitcoin) so I can have a larger giving budget and grow my spirit of generosity at a faster rate.

I also believe that a person can only do this properly once he is debt-free. I think a Bible quote “Borrower is a slave to the lender” is true divine wisdom. Therefore, I do not believe it is possible to cultivate a spirit of generosity while in debt. For this reason, I advise paying off debt prior to beginning giving practice. Giving money while in debt can result in resentment toward the lender. It will also slow down one's debt repayment. And the longer one is in debt, the stronger the spirit of slavery, confusion, and restlessness grows, causing a slew of other negative consequences.

So to add to the example above, let's say I had the same net worth, $200k, but this time I also had debt. For example, I owned a $395k house, had $5k in money (Bitcoin), and owed $200k on my mortgage. This $200k debt would have a wide range of negative effects. So I'd start by selling the $395k house, paying off the $200k in debt, and then proceeding as described above. If I decided to pay back that debt over time (which I wouldn't recommend for the reason that negative spirits caused by the state of debt grow with time one stays in the state of debt), then I'd remove giving category from the budget, and do either debt snowball or debt avalanche strategy.
