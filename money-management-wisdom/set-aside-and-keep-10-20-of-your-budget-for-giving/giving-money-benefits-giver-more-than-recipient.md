# Giver Gets More Benefit From Giving Than The Recipient

We should set aside 10% to 20% of our budget for the Giving category. We should also keep this portion of our budget assigned to the Giving category at all times. So when we spend from it, we recalculate 10% to 20% of what is left in our total budget and move money from other categories to Giving in order to adjust it back. When we spend money from other categories, we recalculate 10% to 20% of what is left in our total budget and adjust the amount in the Giving category.

We should do this primarily for the benefit of cultivating our spirit of generosity. And the spirit of generosity will increase our capacity to generate higher inflows.

We should always continue this practice as our inflows and net worth grow. If we do this correctly, our giving transactions will increase in size and frequency, further cultivating a spirit of generosity and increasing our capacity to generate even higher inflows. We should never stop doing this. Instead, we should think of it as becoming a habit.
