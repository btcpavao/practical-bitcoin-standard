# Set Aside And KeepÂ 10-20% Of Your Budget For Giving

The third step is to create a budget category for giving and ensure that 10% to 20% of our money is always set aside for it. The main goal of this step is to consistently increase our inflows. By making transactions from Giving category, we'll grow our spirit of generosity. Our happiness is directly proportional to the strength of our generosity spirit. The happier we are, the better we will be at providing value to others. And the more value we can provide to others, the greater our earning capacity.

### Giver Gets More Benefit From Giving Than The Recipient

We should set aside 10% to 20% of our budget for the Giving category. We should also keep this portion of our budget assigned to the Giving category at all times. So when we spend from it, we recalculate 10% to 20% of what is left in our total budget and move money from other categories to Giving in order to adjust it back. When we spend money from other categories, we recalculate 10% to 20% of what is left in our total budget and adjust the amount in the Giving category.

We should do this primarily for the benefit of cultivating our spirit of generosity. And the spirit of generosity will increase our capacity to generate higher inflows.

We should always continue this practice as our inflows and net worth grow. If we do this correctly, our giving transactions will increase in size and frequency, further cultivating a spirit of generosity and increasing our capacity to generate even higher inflows. We should never stop doing this. Instead, we should think of it as becoming a habit.

### Giving Cultivates Spirit Of Generosity

You grow the spirit of generosity each and every time you make a financial transaction without expecting anything in return (defined as a giving transaction, that is, a transaction that deducted money from your budget's Giving category).

Consider it like watering a seed; as you continue to water it, it will eventually grow larger.

Most of the time, people immediately feel the effect of stimulating the growth of spirit of generosity. It's an incredibly uplifting feeling that can brighten your day on its own.

Not only that, but the emotion sort of lingers even after the transaction has been completed and some time has passed. Every new giving transaction you complete sort of builds upon the one before, creating a cumulative effect.

You become more and more immersed in this spirit as time goes on. It is similar to an aura, radiates outwards more and more, and has no cap on how large it can get.

Being generous also has the effect of granting you a sort of "permission" to enjoy spending your money on yourself. Most often, even if their budget allows for it and they want it, people who don't practice giving will feel guilty if they want to buy something for themselves that they deem "too expensive" or just "too much." This is true even if their budget allows for it and they want it. Giving transactions as a regular practice can help to reduce this subconcious sense of guilt.

Make a giving transaction in advance of any potentially stressful professional situation you may be in (such as a job interview, a difficult client negotiation you might anticipate, or the hiring or firing of an employee). Any communication benefits from having at least one party with a spirit of generosity.

### Giving Increases Risk Tolerance

In our professional lives, we will constantly come across opportunities to take risks with favorable rewards.

In other words, we have many opportunities with a favorable risk/reward ratio.

When we regularly practice giving, we naturally increase our overall risk tolerance and are able to take on higher risks with higher rewards.

This is because we are already accustomed to spending money without expecting anything in return, other than our spirit of generosity growing.

So, in this context, even if we make an investment with a favorable risk/return ratio but do not make the return, we are still benefiting and are not subject to the sunk cost fallacy.
