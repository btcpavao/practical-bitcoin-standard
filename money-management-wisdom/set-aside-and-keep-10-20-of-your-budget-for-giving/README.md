# Set Aside And KeepÂ 10-20% Of Your Budget For Giving

The third step is to create a budget category for giving and ensure that 10% to 20% of our money is always set aside for it. The main goal of this step is to consistently increase our inflows. By making transactions from Giving category, we'll grow our spirit of generosity. Our happiness is directly proportional to the strength of our generosity spirit. The happier we are, the better we will be at providing value to others. And the more value we can provide to others, the greater our earning capacity.

### Giver Gets More Benefit From Giving Than The Recipient

We should set aside 10% to 20% of our budget for the Giving category. We should also keep this portion of our budget assigned to the Giving category at all times. So when we spend from it, we recalculate 10% to 20% of what is left in our total budget and move money from other categories to Giving in order to adjust it back. When we spend money from other categories, we recalculate 10% to 20% of what is left in our total budget and adjust the amount in the Giving category.

We should do this primarily for the benefit of cultivating our spirit of generosity. And the spirit of generosity will increase our capacity to generate higher inflows.

We should always continue this practice as our inflows and net worth grow. If we do this correctly, our giving transactions will increase in size and frequency, further cultivating a spirit of generosity and increasing our capacity to generate even higher inflows. We should never stop doing this. Instead, we should think of it as becoming a habit.

### Giving Cultivates Spirit Of Generosity

You grow the spirit of generosity each and every time you make a financial transaction without expecting anything in return (defined as a giving transaction, that is, a transaction that deducted money from your budget's Giving category).

Consider it like watering a seed; as you continue to water it, it will eventually grow larger.

Most of the time, people immediately feel the effect of stimulating the growth of spirit of generosity. It's an incredibly uplifting feeling that can brighten your day on its own.

Not only that, but the emotion sort of lingers even after the transaction has been completed and some time has passed. Every new giving transaction you complete sort of builds upon the one before, creating a cumulative effect.

You become more and more immersed in this spirit as time goes on. It is similar to an aura, radiates outwards more and more, and has no cap on how large it can get.

Being generous also has the effect of granting you a sort of "permission" to enjoy spending your money on yourself. Most often, even if their budget allows for it and they want it, people who don't practice giving will feel guilty if they want to buy something for themselves that they deem "too expensive" or just "too much." This is true even if their budget allows for it and they want it. Giving transactions as a regular practice can help to reduce this subconcious sense of guilt.

Make a giving transaction in advance of any potentially stressful professional situation you may be in (such as a job interview, a difficult client negotiation you might anticipate, or the hiring or firing of an employee). Any communication benefits from having at least one party with a spirit of generosity.

### Giving Increases Risk Tolerance

In our professional lives, we will constantly come across opportunities to take risks with favorable rewards.

In other words, we have many opportunities with a favorable risk/reward ratio.

When we regularly practice giving, we naturally increase our overall risk tolerance and are able to take on higher risks with higher rewards.

This is because we are already accustomed to spending money without expecting anything in return, other than our spirit of generosity growing.

So, in this context, even if we make an investment with a favorable risk/return ratio but do not make the return, we are still benefiting and are not subject to the sunk cost fallacy.

### Giving Increases Capacity For Generating Inflows

If you earned your money through a voluntary, consensual exchange with another person, that person (your employer, client, or customer) valued the good or service you provided more than the money he paid you for it. As a result, the act of earning money is valuable in and of itself, and you are already acting morally when you are earning money. Voluntary exchange generates value for both parties.

"Giving back to society" is one of the worst phrases you will ever hear. If you pause and think about it, the phrase "giving back to society" implies that by earning money, you somehow took it away from society (thus, you are now giving it back). The right approach is to say that by earning your money, you already generated value for society, and by giving to charity, you want to improve your ability to earn money, which means you will be bringing even more value to society.

Giving money will make you more capable and better at earning money, because it will make you better at serving your customers. Your customers will like you more if you have a generous spirit because you'll be a more enjoyable person to be around. They will be more inclined to provide you with honest feedback on your goods or services, which will have a positive ripple effect on all your business operations down the line.

Also, you won't spend as much time worrying about insignificant problems that can occur in any business. When you make a mistake in business, such as selecting the incorrect partner or supplier or running into a "bad" customer who is dissatisfied with your offering and requests a refund, you will be able to quickly move on from them, learn your lesson, but do so in a way that doesn't use up any of your creative ability. This is due to the fact that you can always consider this expense to be a part of your overall giving. This frees you up to focus on what matters, which is figuring out how to serve your customers more effectively.

Generous people generally have better moods and a brighter, happier outlook on life. We all enjoy being around them because we don't feel they expect anything from us. They are simply allowing us to benefit from their state of being without taking anything away from them. It's like sunshine: if I enjoy it, it doesn't take away from someone else's enjoyment of it.

A generous person will always approach business negotiations from a win-win rather than a win-lose perspective. The negotiating party will always pick up on this and adopt it as well. And for a generous person, when they ocassionaly realize the counterparty is trying hard to negotiate down, they may still accept the deal to make the other person happy they won the negotiation. A generous person will always default to a long-term perspective: even if I don't make money on this particular deal - this negotiation is a win for me because it increased my generosity.

This has tremendous business power.

### Be Grateful For The Opportunity To Give

Our spirit of generosity is increased each time we make a transaction from our Giving category.

We should always keep in mind that this action may or may not result in a benefit for the recipient. But always and without fail, we will generate benefit for our spiritual blueprint, leading to a growth in spirit of generosity.

As a result, we are not even looking for a "thank you" from the recipient, let alone seeking anything in return. In fact, we should be grateful that we had the opportunity to practice this act of giving.

Every time we make a transaction from the Giving category, our generosity will continue to grow, and if we remain thankful for the chance to do so, we'll feel more satisfied with our net worth and generally more optimistic about the future.

### Giving Increases Happiness

There will always be those who have more than we do, and those who have less.

We can compare our circumstances to those of others who are in a better position than us, which will make us feel inadequate and envious and lower our general level of happiness.

Alternatively, we can practice giving, which will always make us feel as though we have more than we need and will make us happier all around.

The feeling of having and producing value that other people can benefit from is what makes us happy when we practice giving. When we give, we feel like we have something valuable to offer others, which makes us happy.

We have a deep understanding that everyone benefits from our agency in the world. We can enjoy the things we give to ourselves more when we know that we can give to others and make them happy. We can enjoy the things we give to ourselves more when we understand that we can give to others and make them happy. We begin to fully grasp the interdependence of all humans and develop a profound appreciation for one another.
