# Two States Of Being (In Debt And Debt-Free) Generate 6 Different Spirits

Spending credit taints a person's psychospiritual makeup with the spirits of slavery, restlesness and confusion.&#x20;

You can be either "In Debt" or "Debt Free" in your spiritual makeup. They both cultivate the growth of different spirits: when you are in debt, you cultivate the spirit of slavery, restlesness and confusion, and when you are debt-free, you cultivate the spirit of freedom, peace and clarity.

There is no such thing as "good" or "bad" debt, but there is a specific psychospiritual mechanism that one state cultivates over the other. It may be helpful to imagine your soul as a soil, with seeds of various spirits inside that are kind of laying there, dormant. When a seed is watered (in this metaphor, watering the seed is analogous to a specific practice), it sprouts and begins to grow.

If you keep watering it, it will get bigger, stronger, grow roots and a trunk, and eventually produce fruit.

When you owe money (i.e. have a liability on your balance sheet), you begin to "water" the seed of the spirit of slavery, restlesness and confusion.

When you have no liabilities, that is, you owe no money to anyone, you begin to "water" the spirit of freedom, peace and clarity.

## In Debt Spirits

### Spirit Of Slavery

Spiritually, the borrower is a slave of the lender. Slavery here is defined as not having freedom on deciding how to utilize time. There is the extent to which this freedom is reduced, and it's measured in the amount of time you will need to allocate for servicing the debt for the duration of the debt.&#x20;

People can intuitively sense this spirit in you by watching how you spend your money, do your job, and spend your free time. In general, the longer and more deeply in debt you are, the less free time you will have, the more stressful working life will be, and the more tightly you will have to restrict your spending.

Spirit of slavery gives off a subtle energy of desperation that other people can sense. This aura will keep inflow opportunities away. No one likes to deal with the desperate because it makes them feel bad if they do nothing to help. An answer for this is to make giving a regular habit.

When a person lacks a well-established giving practice and senses desperation emanating from the spirit of slavery in another person, they will seek to avoid or minimize economic interaction with that person.

The spirit of slavery means you can't fully control how you spend your time. Your time will be partially or fully used to service the debt.

The spirit of slavery gets stronger the longer you're in debt. Once you eliminate debt, it stops growing. The longer you stay out of debt, the slower it'll grow back if you decide to get into debt again.

Imagine it as an obstacle that arises when you lose the spirit of freedom. Rather than being surrounded by fruitful trees, it filled your environment with thorns and weeds. The presence of the spirit of slavery intensifies every challenge you encounter. The spirit of slavery consumes your sense of pleasure and intensifies your hardships.

Can you decide to dedicate the next six months of your life to a business venture that has an 80% chance of doubling your income in just one year? If you're already in debt for over a year and still have over 6 months of payments to go, then it's not happening.

Because of this, the spirit of slavery brings about opportunity cost on both your future inflows and your past inflows during your time in debt. Once you attain a debt-free state, the opportunity cost vanishes, leading to higher inflows and lower outflows over time as the spirit of freedom grows.

Once you are debt-free for at least one year, you can dedicate the following six months to a business venture with an 80% chance of doubling your income in a year.

Even if the inflow doesn't double (20% chance), you can repeat the process with the same time frames and odds. This time, since you'll have been out of debt for two years, you'll be able to plan your decisions for up to two years.

### Spirit Of Restlesness

Being in a state of debt means constantly worrying about making the next payment on time. This produces the spirit of restlessness.

The stability of your income source is crucial because debt repayment is your top priority. If your source of income encounters financial difficulties, it will directly affect you. Regardless of your conscious awareness, this will fuel your restlessness.

Your spirit of restlessness affects those around you.

Restlessness leads to impatience.

It disturbs sleep and negatively affects health.

It lowers the overall ability to earn money.

### Spirit Of Confusion

The main cause of the spirit of confusion is your choice to spend money from the uncertain future.

Humans can only make valuations in the present, and they can be informed by the certainty of their previous valuations.

When you spend from the future, you get confused about the value of what you bought. This is because you performed present valuation on the present thing you bought, but did so with future money. But in the future, your valuation can change completely.

Confusion raises the cost of ownership of the item you purchased because you are less likely to properly care for it. You are not properly caring for it because it is not truly yours until you pay it off.

Nevertheless, your valuation of the thing may change during the payoff period, and you may value the money you are paying for it more than the thing itself.

However, if you try to liquidate the thing and pay off the debt, you may find that the depreciation of the thing, combined with your reduced ongoing maintenance costs, increased the cost of ownership so much that you are unable to pay off the debt completely by simply liquidating the thing. In other words, you are "underwater," as the asset you are attempting to liquidate is worth less than your debt.

The spirit of confusion will make it more difficult for you to realistically mark to market the value of the item you purchased with debt. Because you know that just looking at it will make things more confusing, you won't want to.

## Debt-Free Spirits

### Spirit Of Freedom

A place where you are fully in control of how you utilize your ultimate resource: time.

By staying debt-free, the spirit of freedom grows with time.

View it as an asset, akin to a tree that flourishes and bears more fruit as it grows, as long as you remain debt-free. It needs time to grow. When you enter a state of debt, the growth of your spirit of freedom stops, and it resumes when you get out of debt.

The more spirit of freedom you have, the greater your ability to decide how to utilize your time.

If your spirit of freedom is one year old, you have the ability to decide how you spend your time for up to a year. If it's "ten years old," you can determine how to allocate your time for the next ten years.

The longer you stay out of debt, the better you become at understanding and utilizing your remaining time in the future.

### Spirit Of Peace

When you don't have to worry about your next debt payment, you can sleep peacefully and find serenity.

When you have the spirit of peace, you can appreciate what you have more.

Spirit of peace allows you to be fully present.

The spirit of peace has the power to heal both your mind and body, leading to improved overall health.

Your spirit of peace will bring peace to those around you.

### Spirit Of Clarity

Spirit of clarity manifests as a heightened awareness of the value of each purchase you make, for you. If you consider its value for you is greater than the expense, you will choose to buy it. if not, you won’t.

As your spirit of clarity grows over time, you will continue gaining a more heightened awareness of the value of your purchases for you.

The spirit of clarity will help you keep tabs on your belongings. Once you value an item less than the money it can sell for, you’ll choose to sell it. This will help you keep fine-tuning your net worth composition.
