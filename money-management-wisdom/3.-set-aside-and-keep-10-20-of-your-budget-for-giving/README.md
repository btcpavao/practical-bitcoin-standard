# 3. Set Aside And KeepÂ 10-20% Of Your Budget For Giving

The third step is to create a budget category for giving and ensure that 10% to 20% of our money is always set aside for it. The main goal of this step is to consistently increase our inflows. By making transactions from Giving category, we'll grow our spirit of generosity. Our happiness is directly proportional to the strength of our generosity spirit. The happier we are, the better we will be at providing value to others. And the more value we can provide to others, the greater our earning capacity.
