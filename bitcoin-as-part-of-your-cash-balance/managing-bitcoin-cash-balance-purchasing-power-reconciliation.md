# Managing Bitcoin Cash Balance: Purchasing Power Reconciliation

* we are used to using fiat as our cash balance (physical cash in our wallets, checking accounts, immediately available savings accounts), and most bitcoiners think about bitcoin as their "investment", "retirement", "long term savings", and will track it as part of their balance sheet like an asset
* if you successfuly implemented prior three steps as your rock solid foundation (running zero based budget for at least 180 days, eliminated all debt from your balance sheet, and established regular giving practice with 10% to 20% of your budget), you should strongly consider starting to treat bitcoin as part of your cash balance, and upgrading to full bitcoin standard
* when you start using bitcoin as part your cash balance, you will need to introduce one more practice in your zero based budgeting - purchasing power reconciliation
* how does this work?
* say you currently have $10,000 worth of bitcoin, and you use it as your cash balance. you don't have any other forms of money at the moment, $10,000 of bitcoin is all you have.
* this means you will assign $10,000 to your budget categories, until there is 0 left to assign.
* but what do you do if bitcoin exchange rate drops by 20% in a day? you perform budget reconciliation. the amounts you assigned to your budget categories previously are now actually more than you have in your budget.
* let's use our example for $10,000:&#x20;
  * $2,000 in Giving
  * $2,000 in Shelter
  * $2,000 in Groceries
  * $2,000 in Transport
  * $2,000 in Everything Else
  * if suddenly your bitcoin is worth $8,000, this means you need to adjust your budget categories, because your budget currently has $2,000 assigned more than you actually have. so let's adjust the budget by subtracting $2,000 total from our categories, $400 from each:
    * $2,000 in Giving -> $1,600 in Giving
    * $2,000 in Shelter -> $1,600 in Shelter
    * $2,000 in Groceries -> $1,600 in Groceries
    * $2,000 in Transport -> $1,600 in Transport
    * $2,000 in Everything Else -> $1,600 in Everything Else
* now, our budget is back in balance
* what do we do if bitcoin exchange rate increases by 20% in a day? same thing, we perform budget reconciliation. we assigned $10,000 in our initial budget, but we now have $12,000 in the budget, which means we have $2,000 extra to assign. so we do it by adding extra $400 to each category:
  * $2,000 in Giving -> $2,400 in Giving
  * $2,000 in Shelter -> $2,400 in Shelter
  * $2,000 in Groceries -> $2,400 in Groceries
  * $2,000 in Transport -> $2,400 in Transport
  * $2,000 in Everything Else -> $2,400 in Everything Else
* now, our budget is once again back in balance, i.e. we have zero money left to assign.
* how often do we need to do this? it's really up to you, but I'd advise doing this often, especially if the change is more than couple of percent in either way. every time you reconcile the budget this way, you may take the opportunity to further fine tune assigned amounts in different categories.
