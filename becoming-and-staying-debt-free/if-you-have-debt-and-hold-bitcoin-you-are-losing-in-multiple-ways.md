# If You Have Debt And Hold Bitcoin, You Are Losing In Multiple Ways

* you think you are making money on spread between interest rate you are paying on debt and bitcoin cagr rate
* you are ignoring/forgetting several issues:
  * the opportunity cost of your stress by doing this
  * the increased cost of ownership due to you having less money for maintenance of the thing you bought with debt, thus incurring higher real depreciation rate
  * the opportunity cost of not being able to grow spirit of generosity & more income that would produce
  * future is uncertain (unquantifiable), while your interest is quantified
  * your valuation of the thing you bought with debt can change over time. often you just end up with a thing you now don't like, but have to pay for because your starting evaluation was different
  * bitcoin volatility can throw you off the plan. if it moves up and you don't pay the debt off, you will likely want to double down and take on more debt to chase the pump. if it moves down, your stress will increase even more because you are now liable for payments on something you underwater with
* not only are you losing money, but the stress of being in debt will taint the experience of joy you'd have with things you own if you didn't have debt
