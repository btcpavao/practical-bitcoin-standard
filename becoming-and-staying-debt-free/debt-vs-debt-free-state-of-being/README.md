# Debt Vs Debt-Free State Of Being

there are two distinct states of spiritual makeup: one is "In Debt" and the other is "Debt Free". they both cultivate growth of different spirits: when you are in debt you cultivate spirit of slavery, and when you are debt free you cultivate spirit of freedom

* there is no such thing as "good" or "bad" debt, but there is a precise psychospiritual mechanism that one vs the other state cultivates
* it may be helpful to imagine your soul like a soil, with seeds of different spirits inside that are kind of laying there, dormant. when a seed gets watered (in this metaphor, watering the seed would be akin to a certain practice), it sprouts and starts to grow. if it is continually watered, it grows bigger, stronger, develops roots, grows a trunk and ultimately bears fruit.
* when you owe money (i.e. you have liability on your balance sheet), this starts to "water" the seed of spirit of slavery
* when you have zero liabilities, i.e. you don't owe money to anybody, this starts to "water" the spirit of freedom
