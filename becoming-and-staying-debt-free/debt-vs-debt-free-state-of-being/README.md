# Debt Vs Debt-Free State Of Being

* spending credit makes your psychospiritual makeup tainted by spirit of slavery. metaphysically, you as a borrower are slave to the lender.
* people can intuintively sense this spirit in you by the way you approach spending money, your work and your leisure time. the deeper and longer in debt you are, you will have less leisure time, your work will be more stressful, and your money spending more constrained. this aura will repel inflow opportunities that otherwise may arise, because spirit of slavery emanates energy of desperation, which other people can sense. nobody really wants to deal with desperate people, because deep down, if you sense that someone is desperate - you feel guilty if you don't help him out. the antidote for this is to establish a giving practice, but if you still haven't done so, you will usually just want to avoid dealing with people with whom you sense this air of desperation.

there are two distinct states of spiritual makeup: one is "In Debt" and the other is "Debt Free". they both cultivate growth of different spirits: when you are in debt you cultivate spirit of slavery, and when you are debt free you cultivate spirit of freedom

* there is no such thing as "good" or "bad" debt, but there is a precise psychospiritual mechanism that one vs the other state cultivates
* it may be helpful to imagine your soul like a soil, with seeds of different spirits inside that are kind of laying there, dormant. when a seed gets watered (in this metaphor, watering the seed would be akin to a certain practice), it sprouts and starts to grow. if it is continually watered, it grows bigger, stronger, develops roots, grows a trunk and ultimately bears fruit.
* when you owe money (i.e. you have liability on your balance sheet), this starts to "water" the seed of spirit of slavery
* when you have zero liabilities, i.e. you don't owe money to anybody, this starts to "water" the spirit of freedom
