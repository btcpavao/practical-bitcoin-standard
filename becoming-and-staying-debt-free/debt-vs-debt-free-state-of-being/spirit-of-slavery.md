# Spirit Of Slavery

* a place from which you do not have full control over the decision about utilizing your ultimate resource: your time. your time is partially or fully utilized to service the debt
* spirit of slavery also grows over time you stay in debt. eliminating debt from your balance sheet stops the growth of it. the longer you stay out of debt, the slower it will grow back if you decide to get into debt again
* think of it as a hinderance you get when you lose the asset of spirit of freedom (no more tree that grows and bears fruit, but instead you get thorns and weeds that make everything more difficult, painful and less enjoyable)
