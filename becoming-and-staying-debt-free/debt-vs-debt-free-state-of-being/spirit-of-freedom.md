# Spirit Of Freedom

* a place from which you have full control over the decision about utilizing your ultimate resource: your time
* spirit of freedom grows over time you stay out of debt. entering into a state of debt stops the growth of it, and it resumes it's growth when you get out of debt
* think of it as an asset, like a tree that grows bigger and stronger and bears more fruit over time, as long as you stay out of debt
