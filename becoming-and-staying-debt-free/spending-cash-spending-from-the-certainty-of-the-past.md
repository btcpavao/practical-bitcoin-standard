# Spending Cash = Spending From The Certainty Of The Past

* spending money you already have means you are 100% aware of it's opportunity cost (because your money is already assigned in the budget)
* whatever you are spending on and paying cash, you will always get a better price than if you were spending on the same thing using credit
* this means you will eliminate the cost of debt risk expressed in interest rate & discount for the same item when paying in cash.
* spending from past means you will eliminate the opportunity cost of debt from your future inflows.
* these two factors will reduce your outflow rate overall, and the best way to "spend less in general" is really to spend only money you already have. being and staying debt free is the best way to reduce wasteful outflows
