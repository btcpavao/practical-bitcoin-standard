# You Eliminating Your Debt Eases Transition From Fiat To Bitcoin Standard For You And Everyone Else

* whenever licensed bank makes a loan, it creates new money supply
* whenever you pay back or default on such loan, money supply is destroyed
* when you pay back your debt to the bank, you reduced fiat supply, and by doing so you increased purchasing power of people who still hold fiat in their cash balance
* you slightly increased interest rate for new debt issuance for everyone else, thus slightly reduced their demand for taking on new debt
* if you stay debt free until the rest of your life, you reduced the demand for new fiat creation from yourself. by proxy you made it more expensive for everyone else to get into debt
* bitcoin monetization happens by people converting their present money to bitcoin (increasing bitcoin spot price) but also by people who convert their credit to bitcoin (leveraged bitcoin buying, getting into debt to buy bitcoin, or buying bitcoin while still having debt on the balance sheet).
* however, credit funded bitcoin purchases lead to more violent parabolic moves in bitcoin price, which when exhausted (can't take more debt) lead to more violent bitcoin price crashes due to liquidation cascade effect.
* bitcoin monetization would be less volatile without debt
* your increased demand for holding bitcoin cash balance increases its purchasing power, which attracts others to do the same. if you do this without debt, you make it even more compelling for lenders to sell their loans and hold bitcoin instead. less debt means less capital misallocation and less government funding -> more free market signal -> more civilization
