# Outflows Are Increased Because Of Interest, Opportunity Cost & Misallocation

* spending credit is always more expensive than spending cash, because of the interest
* interest you pay over the duration of the debt has two opportunity cost sources: the amount you would save by getting a discount if you paid for the same thing with cash plus the total interest you will pay over the duration of the debt
* your opportunity cost should be calculated in purchasing power appreciation if it was saved in bitcoin during the duration of the debt
