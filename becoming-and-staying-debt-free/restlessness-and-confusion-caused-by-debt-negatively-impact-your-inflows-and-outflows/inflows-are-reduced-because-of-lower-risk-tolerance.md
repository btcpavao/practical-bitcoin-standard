# Inflows Are Reduced Because of Lower Risk Tolerance

* your bank of time is your most valuable resource. with every business opportunity, you are incurring certain risk by investing your time in it, but you are doing so with the intention to have more quantity and quality of time
* risk and return are two sides of the same coin.
* even with zero risk and X positive return, you still have opportunity cost of taking higher than zero risk and getting higher than X positive return. thus effectively, you can't avoid taking risk
* there are positive and negative opportunities, both include risk
* every additional claim on your future time (debt) reduces your capacity to take risk with your time
* at 100% debts to assets ratio, all your time is spent servicing the debt, and you can't take any risks with your time
* this is where you start incurring heavy opportunity cost, because there will be risks larger than zero that will get you higher return than what you have, but you can't take them at all.
