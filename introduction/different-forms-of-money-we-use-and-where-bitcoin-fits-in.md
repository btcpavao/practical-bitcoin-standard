# Different Forms Of Money We Use And Where Bitcoin Fits In

* we use money daily, but for the most part, people don't think too deep about it.
* many books have been written about money
* this manual will use functional definition of money presented by the Austrian school of economics: money is widely used medium of exchange
* after functionally defining money, we'll focus on best practices for managing it, drawn from millenia of wisdom
* why do people use money? because they are value things differently from one another, so they exchange.
* humans are both physical and meta-physical beings (metaphysical = spiritual in the context of this guide)
* humans valuation of things happens in their spiritual aspect &#x20;
* when humans exchange with each other, their subjective valuation increases
* humans can exchange directly, for example: person A has a lot of oranges, and person B has a lot of apples. A wants to exchange some of his oranges for apples and B wants to exchange some of his apples for oranges. they will perform the exchange which ends up benefiting both.
* this exchange is mutually beneficial
* direct exchange runs into a double coincidence of wants problem: for example: person A has a lot of oranges, and person B has a lot of apples. person A wants to exchange some of his oranges for apples, but person B doesn't want oranges, he wants to exchange his apples for bananas. if person A then finds someone to exchange his oranges for bananas, only to then exchange bananas for apples with person B, person A used bananas as medium of exchange. in other words, A acquired bananas not because he wanted bananas, but because his intention was to exchange them for what he really wanted, which is apples. in this scenario, A used bananas as medium of exchange, i.e. money.&#x20;
* medium of exchange is a solution to double coincidence of wants problem&#x20;
* anything can be used as medium of exchange, but some things perform this function better than others
* medium of exchange can be measured in terms of itâ€™s salability (marketability, ease of which it can be sold without a significant loss of it's value).&#x20;
* salability is the difference between bid ask spread.
* salability can be analysed across four different aspects: time, space, scales and goods.
* salability across time - how much does the thing used as medium of exchange increase or decrease in value across the unit of time between exchange. Bitcoin is the best (predictable supply schedule, decreases over time in 33 halvings)&#x20;
* salability across space - how much does the thing used as medium of exchange increase or decrease in value across the unit of space between exchange. Bitcoin is the best (can send it anywhere where there is internet connection without loss of value)&#x20;
* salability across scales - how much does the thing used as medium of exchange increase or decrease in value depending on the size of exchange. Bitcoin is the best (micropayments all the way to massive payments)
* salability across goods - how widely does the thing used as medium of exchange desired / accepted as such. for now in the most parts of the world, government issued fiat money is most widely desired/accepted as medium of exchange, but Bitcoin is rapidly growing in this regard. we can see this in growing number of exchanges, liquidity and compressing bid-ask spreads between Bitcoin and government issued fiat moneys

I'll start by defining what money means in this manual so that it can be as helpful as possible to its readers. You should know this because you probably use some things as money that you wouldn't if Bitcoin was your primary money.

We humans are at the same time similar and different from other species in many ways. We are similar to other species in physical aspects. For example, we, like many other species are mammals, we have a pair of limbs, ten fingers on both hands, two sets of eyes and two sets of ears. We use our bodies to eat, drink, sleep, mate, and have bodily functions.&#x20;

As much as we are similar physically, we are completely different from other species from a metaphysical or spiritual perspective. Bear in mind, the term "spiritual" is used here to refer to non-physical characteristics that cannot be measured like size, weight or volume. Here, "spiritual" refers to the intangible (metaphysical) parts of a human being, such as their optimism, kindness, loyalty, courage, perseverance, hope, resourcefulness, or creativity.&#x20;

In this guide, you'll read about concepts like the "spirit of freedom," the "spirit of slavery," the "spirit of peace," etc. We're referring to these intangible human qualities that we can either foster and grow or stifle and eliminate.

Now, this is very important point: humans use money because while they are similar to each other physically, they can be completely different from one another spiritually. This is the reason people trade with each other -> because they value goods and services differently from each other. When we value things differently, we engage in exchange, beacuse after the exchange we are better off -> we end up with things we value more than whatever we exchanged for them.

So trade, and subsequently emergence of money is a uniquely human phenomenon, and its operation is primarily related to the spiritual realm. Animals do not save money, specialize in one area, or trade with one another. They don't use money and don't assign different values to the same good or service at different points in time or in different locations due to internal spiritual differences.

Trade encounters a significant challenge known as the "double coincidence of wants." This issue arises when A wants what B has, but B does not want what A has in return.

The solution to the problem of the double coincidence of wants is the introduction of a medium of exchange. A medium of exchange is anything that a person acquires with the sole intention of using it to exchange for something they really want to use or consume.&#x20;

So, in our example, if B desires what C possesses, A may attempt to exchange what it has with C, only to then trade it with B. A is acquiring what C has, not because A intends to use it, but solely for the purpose of exchanging it with B. In this case, A used C item as a medium of exchange with B.

Over time, throughout a number of interactions like this, certain goods emerge as better mediums of exchange than others due to their better salability across time, space, and scale.

We define money as the most widely used medium of exchange. While anything can be used as money, some things prove to be more effective than others.

It's crucial to understand that all valuation occurs within our spiritual realm; there is no intrinsic value in physical objects. Our spiritual schematic, comprising all non-physical aspects, determines how we value things.

In essence, money is actually spiritual phenomenon when it comes to how humans exchange goods and services with one another. The physical objects we use as money, such as coins and bills, are like carriers or symbols for this value in the physical world. There is nothing inherent in physical objects that makes them money. They are used and recognized as money by human beings.&#x20;

A gold bar lying on the ground next to a fisherman on the shore is of no value to a seagull. A seagull is considerably more interested in the fish the fisherman catches. The gold bar, however, is more valuable to the fisherman than the fish because he knows he can exchange it for fish or anything else he might want in the future from other people.

This manual is designed to impart wisdom on how to alter our spiritual schematic to become more adept at using money. Remember, we can use anything as money, but I will argue that Bitcoin is the most effective tool for money in today's world.&#x20;

Think of this manual as a guide on cultivating a "spiritual money tree" with three components: roots (zero-based budgeting), trunk and branches (becoming and remaining debt-free), and leaves and fruits (establishing a giving practice). Alternatively, you can envision it as a blueprint for constructing a house, with the foundation being zero-based budgeting, the base ensuring freedom from debt, and the visible structure establishing a giving practice.

1. **Zero-Based Budgeting**: This practice grants us full control over our money by determining its opportunity cost and managing it in the dimension of time.
2. **Becoming and Staying Debt-Free**: This involves eliminating wasteful outflows, which often result from misjudged valuations, by replacing credit spending with cash spending. This process stops the growth of the spirit of slavery and restlessness while fostering the growth of the spirit of freedom and peace.
3. **Establishing a Giving Practice**: This step is focused on increasing our inflows. By practicing generosity, we nurture the spirit of generosity while preventing the growth of the spirit of stinginess. This, in turn, opens up more opportunities to boost our inflows.

## **What Moneys Do You Use?**

It is critical to understand that money is a medium of exchange and that anything can be used as such.

Do you know someone who "invests in real estate," that is, buys properties not to live in or rent out but rather to "store value," with the goal of later selling them for a higher price than they paid for them? If that's the case, then this person is using real estate as money.

Some of the most popular instruments that people around the world use as money include banknotes, coins, fiat bank checking accounts, fiat bank savings accounts, credit, government bonds, corporate bonds, stock index funds, mutual funds, precious metals, art, real estate, altcoins, stablecoins...

The goal of this guide is to help you get ready to use Bitcoin as your primary money and give you the tools you need to do so. This doesn't mean you'll never use any other kind of money again. There is a good chance that you reside in an area where most people use government-issued fiat currency as their primary means of exchange.&#x20;

But this doesn't mean you can't use Bitcoin as your main form of money. It just means that for most of your daily spending, you'll need to exchange bitcoin for your local government's fiat currency. On the other hand, you can convert any income you make, regardless of the currency in which it is paid to you, into Bitcoin.

If you follow the recommendations provided in this guide, you won't need to "hedge Bitcoin's volatility" anymore, and you won't think of bitcoin as a long term illiquid investment that you "don't touch". Instead, you will learn to treat it as your primary cash balance, which means you will frequently convert from fiat to Bitcoin and back, depending on your goals.
