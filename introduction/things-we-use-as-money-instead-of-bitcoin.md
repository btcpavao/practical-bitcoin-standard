# What Is Often Used As Money, And Why Use Bitcoin As Money

It is critical to understand that money is a medium of exchange and that anything can be used as such.

Do you know someone who "invests in real estate," that is, buys properties not to live in or rent out but rather to "store value," with the goal of later selling them for a higher price than they paid for them? If that's the case, then this person is using real estate as money.

Some of the most popular instruments that people around the world use as money:

* banknotes
* fiat checking accounts
* fiat savings accounts
* credit
* government bonds
* corporate bonds
* stock index funds
* mutual funds
* precious metals
* art
* real estate
* altcoins
* stablecoins

The purpose of this guide is to prepare you to be completely intentional about what you will use as money, as well as to provide you with tools to begin using bitcoin as your only money. The majority of your daily transactions will probably still be made using fiat currency issued by your local government, but you will feel confident switching all of your current money instruments that are inferior to bitcoin to bitcoin and start to use bitcoin as part of your cash balance.

If you follow the recommendations provided in this guide, you won't need to "hedge bitcoin's volatility" anymore, and you won't think of bitcoin as a long term illiquid investment that you "don't touch". Instead, you will learn to treat it as your primary cash balance, which means you will frequently convert from fiat to bitcoin and back, depending on your goals.
