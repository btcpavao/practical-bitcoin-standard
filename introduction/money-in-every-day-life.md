# Money In Every Day Life

I want this manual to be as useful as possible. To do this, I must start with the basics and define what money is in the context of this manual. If you want to dive deeper into economy of Bitcoin, I would recommend that you read all three books by Saifedean Ammous: The Bitcoin Standard, The Fiat Standard, and Principles of Economics.

We are all different people. Physically, we do differ somewhat, but we are similar to one another. People have two legs, two arms, ten fingers on each hand, two eyes, and two ears. We eat, drink, sleep, mate, and have bodily functions.&#x20;

From this perspective, we are very similar to many other animals that live on Earth. But what makes people different from animals is not how different they are physically, but how different they are spiritually.

When I say spiritual, I'm referring to things that are impossible to measure and define physically, like weight, height, and temperature. In this context, spiritual refers to non-physical (metaphysical) qualities such as patience, loyalty, diligence, and so on. When I say "spirits," I mean non-physical aspects of humans that can be grown and cultivated or eliminated/diminished.

Animals will never engage in capital accumulation. Animals do not specialize and trade. No animal has ever used money.

But humans do. Humans value goods and services they make for each other differently at different points in time and space due to their spiritual differences.

Due to this, humans trade goods and services with one another. Person A trades with B because what B has is more valuable to A than what A has, and B values what A has more than what B has. So, as a result of the exchange, they both value the things they now have more than they did before the exchange.

Direct trade encounters the problem of double coincidence of wants. A wants what B has, but B doesn't want what A has.&#x20;

The solution to the problem of double coincidence of wants is a medium of exchange. A medium of exchange is anything that a person acquires with the intention of exchanging it for something they actually want to use/consume. If B wants what C has, then A attempts to exchange what it has with C, only to exchange it with B. A is acquiring what C has, not because A wants to utilize the thing itself, but only to exchange it with B.

Because of their salability across time, space, and scale, certain goods emerge as better mediums of exchange than others over time.

Money is a widely used medium of exchange. Anything can be used as money, but some things are more effective than others. It is critical to understand that all valuation happens in our spiritual part; there is nothing intrinsically valuable in physical objects. Our spiritual schematic (the sum of all our non-physical aspects) determines how we value things.

Money is therefore a spiritual phenomenon when it comes to how humans exchange goods and services with one another.

This manual is about wisdom on how to change our spiritual schematic to become better at using money. Remember, we can use anything as money, and I'll argue that the best tool we can use as money today is Bitcoin.

Thing of this manual like a guide on how to grow a "spiritual money tree" that has three parts: roots (zero-based budgeting), trunk and branches (becoming and remaining debt free), and leaves and fruits (establishing a giving practice). If you like, you can also imagine this as a blueprint for building a house, with the understructure (foundation) being zero-based budgeting, the plinth (base) becoming and staying debt-free, and the superstructure (visible part of the building) establishing giving practice.

First, zero-based budgeting is a practice that allows us to have complete control over our money by deciding its opportunity cost and controlling it in the dimension of time.

Second, becoming and staying debt-free involves eliminating wasteful (misjudged valuations) outflows by eliminating credit spending and replacing it with cash spending. This fully stops the growth of the spirit of slavery and restlessness and initiates the growth of the spirit of freedom and peace.

Third, establishing a giving practice is about increasing our inflows. Practicing this will grow the spirit of generosity and prevent the growth of the spirit of stinginess, leading to more opportunities to increase our inflows.
