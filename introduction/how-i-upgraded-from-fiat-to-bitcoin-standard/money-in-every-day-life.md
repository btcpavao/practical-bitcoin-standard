# Money In Every Day Life

In order to create a manual that is as useful as possible, it's important to begin with the basics and define what money represents in the context of this guide. This is essential because you must realize that you probably use some things as money that you wouldn't if you used Bitcoin as your primary money.

Let's start talking about money in abstract, what it is, why people use it.

We as human beings are physically unique to some extent. But we also share many similarities with other living beings on Earth. Physically, we have two legs, two arms, ten fingers on each hand, two eyes, and two ears. We engage in activities such as eating, drinking, sleeping, mating, and have bodily functions. From a physical perspective, we are not much different from many other animals inhabiting the planet.&#x20;

What truly sets us humans apart from animals is not our physical differences but our spiritual ones.

When we refer to the term "spiritual" in this context, we're talking about qualities and attributes that cannot be measured or defined in physical terms like weight, height, or temperature.&#x20;

In this sense, "spiritual" pertains to non-physical (metaphysical) aspects of human existence, such as patience, loyalty, diligence, optimism, resourcefulness, creativity and so forth.&#x20;

When we mention "spirits," like "spirit of freedom", "spirit of slavery", "spirit of peace" etc, we're addressing these non-physical aspects of humans that can be nurtured and developed or diminished and extinguished.

Using money is a uniquely human activity, and its functioning primarily pertains to the spiritual world.

Animals do not engage in capital accumulation, specialization, or trade. They do not use money, and they do not place different values on goods and services at different points in time and space due to spiritual differences among themselves.

However, humans are distinct in that they do engage in these activities. Humans value goods and services they create or possess differently at various times and in various places because of their spiritual attributes. This diversity in valuation leads humans to exchange goods and services with one another.&#x20;

If Person A and Person B value what the other person has more than what they have, they will trade with one another. The result of this voluntary exchange is that both A and B will value the same items more after exchanging them with one another.

However, direct trade encounters a significant challenge known as the "double coincidence of wants." This issue arises when A wants what B has, but B does not want what A has in return.

The solution to the problem of the double coincidence of wants is the introduction of a medium of exchange. A medium of exchange is anything that a person acquires with the sole intention of using it to exchange for something they really want to use or consume.&#x20;

So, in our example, if B desires what C possesses, A may attempt to exchange what it has with C, only to then trade it with B. A is acquiring what C has, not because A intends to use it, but solely for the purpose of exchanging it with B. In this case, A used C item as a medium of exchange with B.

Over time, throughout a number of interactions like this, certain goods emerge as better mediums of exchange than others due to their better salability across time, space, and scale.

We define money as the most widely used medium of exchange. While anything can be used as money, some things prove to be more effective than others.

It's crucial to understand that all valuation occurs within our spiritual realm; there is no intrinsic value in physical objects. Our spiritual schematic, comprising all non-physical aspects, determines how we value things.

In essence, money is actually spiritual phenomenon when it comes to how humans exchange goods and services with one another. The physical objects we use as money, such as coins and bills, are like carriers or symbols for this value in the physical world. There is nothing inherent in physical objects that makes them money. They are used and recognized as money by human beings.&#x20;

A gold bar lying on the ground next to a fisherman on the shore is of no value to a seagull. A seagull is considerably more interested in the fish the fisherman catches. The gold bar, however, is more valuable to the fisherman than the fish because he knows he can exchange it for fish or anything else he might want in the future from other people.

This manual is designed to impart wisdom on how to alter our spiritual schematic to become more adept at using money. Remember, we can use anything as money, but I will argue that Bitcoin is the most effective tool for money in today's world.&#x20;

Think of this manual as a guide on cultivating a "spiritual money tree" with three components: roots (zero-based budgeting), trunk and branches (becoming and remaining debt-free), and leaves and fruits (establishing a giving practice). Alternatively, you can envision it as a blueprint for constructing a house, with the foundation being zero-based budgeting, the base ensuring freedom from debt, and the visible structure establishing a giving practice.

1. **Zero-Based Budgeting**: This practice grants us full control over our money by determining its opportunity cost and managing it in the dimension of time.
2. **Becoming and Staying Debt-Free**: This involves eliminating wasteful outflows, which often result from misjudged valuations, by replacing credit spending with cash spending. This process stops the growth of the spirit of slavery and restlessness while fostering the growth of the spirit of freedom and peace.
3. **Establishing a Giving Practice**: This step is focused on increasing our inflows. By practicing generosity, we nurture the spirit of generosity while preventing the growth of the spirit of stinginess. This, in turn, opens up more opportunities to boost our inflows.

By following these principles and practices, you can achieve greater financial wisdom and ultimately enhance your ability to navigate the world of money and wealth.
