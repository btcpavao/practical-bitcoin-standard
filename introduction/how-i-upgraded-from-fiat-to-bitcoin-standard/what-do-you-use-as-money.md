# What Do You Use As Money?

It is critical to understand that money is a medium of exchange and that anything can be used as such.

Do you know someone who "invests in real estate," that is, buys properties not to live in or rent out but rather to "store value," with the goal of later selling them for a higher price than they paid for them? If that's the case, then this person is using real estate as money.

Some of the most popular instruments that people around the world use as money include banknotes, coins, fiat bank checking accounts, fiat bank savings accounts, credit, government bonds, corporate bonds, stock index funds, mutual funds, precious metals, art, real estate, altcoins, stablecoins...

The goal of this guide is to help you get ready to use bitcoin as your primary money and give you the tools you need to do so. This doesn't mean you'll never use any other kind of money again. There is a good chance that you reside in an area where most people use government-issued fiat currency as their primary means of exchange.&#x20;

But this doesn't mean you can't use bitcoin as your main form of money. It just means that for most of your daily spending, you'll need to exchange bitcoin for your local government's fiat currency. On the other hand, you can convert any income you make, regardless of the currency in which it is paid to you, into bitcoin.

If you follow the recommendations provided in this guide, you won't need to "hedge bitcoin's volatility" anymore, and you won't think of bitcoin as a long term illiquid investment that you "don't touch". Instead, you will learn to treat it as your primary cash balance, which means you will frequently convert from fiat to bitcoin and back, depending on your goals.
