# My Story

I remember hearing and reading about Bitcoin for the first time in 2012, but it didn't really pique my interest at the time, because I thought it was just another virtual currency, like WoW gold. In 2013, I heard about it again in the context of the FBI shutting down the Silk Road marketplace. The involvement of the U.S. government made it more intriguing to me, as it indicated that this wasn't just some code that could be altered at the whim of its creators, and it was used in real commerce.&#x20;

But buying Bitcoin in 2013 meant that I'd have to find a way to wire funds to Mt. Gox in Japan, which I felt was just too cumbersome, so I abandoned the idea.

Then I recall reading in early 2014 that Mt. Gox was defunct and closed as well.&#x20;

I took a break from my entrepreneurial pursuits during the summer of 2014 due to a sort of burnout. I was using this time to clear my mind of many things, and my information intake was fairly light. I came across a short tutorial named "Up And Running With Bitcoin" on Lynda.com (which is now a part of LinkedIn) that briefly explained how Bitcoin worked under the hood, how to install and run Bitcoin Core node software, and how to send and receive transactions.&#x20;

After reading more about it and realizing that the network was still operational even after Silk Road was shut down and Mt. Gox exchange went bankrupt, I decided I should try to acquire and experiment with it this time. Fortunately, where I live in Croatia, there was a small Bitcoin exchange that was just getting started, and I was able to purchase around $20 worth of Bitcoin in July 2014, when the exchange rate was around $600 per BTC.

I did set up the node, receive the transaction, and read a bit more about it on Bitcointalk.org forums, but as the summer drew to a close, I became increasingly preoccupied with my entrepreneurial venture again. By the winter of 2014, I had practically forgotten about my Bitcoin experiment, as I was immersed in a new project that would eventually become a six-cofounder startup in 2015.&#x20;

It wasn't until late 2017 that I suddenly realized Bitcoin was trading around $15,000 per BTC, whereas I distinctly recall purchasing it for around $600 per BTC. This was the moment that made me become so fascinated by the phenomenon, and I think of it as the start of my journey down the rabbit hole.

Fortunately, I had very little time to get exposed to shitcoins, and starting in 2018, I entered my first real Bitcoin bear market. It was when I read "The Bitcoin Standard" by Saifedean Ammous that I understood the basics of monetary economics and the difference between hard and easy money, stock to flow, salability, and the problems money actually solves. My shitcoin phase ended when I stopped analyzing altcoin from the perspective of marketing narratives and a technical lens.

All of this occurred during the 2018 bear market, and by mid-year, I also parted ways with the startup I co-founded. This meant my regular inflows from the startup stopped, and I felt the need to learn how to manage my budget since my savings were starting to get depleted, while income became irregular. I discovered the Dave Ramsey show and his teachings on why people should get out of debt. By listening to hundreds of stories about how people's lives got ruined by debt, I grew convinced that my previous stance on debt was wrong, both in my personal and business life. I started zero-based budgeting, and by the end of 2018, I cleared all of my debt.

By the end of 2018, I also got rid of shitcoins and went Bitcoin-only. Throughout 2019, I freelanced while studying Bitcoin further. I did my first Bitcoin presentations at my former university and conducted some workshops in the small town of Rab where I now live. There wasn't much interest from the public at the time, but I slowly connected with a couple of Bitcoiners from Croatia. Most of my time was spent listening to Bitcoin podcasts, reading Bitcoin Twitter, and trying to find people I could talk to about Bitcoin.

It was in the summer of 2020 when I got the opportunity to start working in the Bitcoin industry by connecting with Saifedean and helping him fix some of the issues he had on his website. We continued working together in a larger capacity from then on, and I delved even deeper into economics and Bitcoin education simply by working behind the scenes, running the operation, and utilizing my former entrepreneurial experience to solve some of the problems we faced, scaling the business further.
