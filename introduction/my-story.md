# My Story

* my bitcoin story
  * first heard about it in 2013, but didn't get to buy any due to Mt. Gox being too cumbersome
  * first "get off zero" moment in July 2014, but only $20 worth
  * forgot about it until late 2017 when I saw raging bull market and BTC crossing $16k, and I remember I bought it at $600
  * luckily I got very little time to get to exposed to shitcoins - and starting in 2018 I entered bear market
  * this was a year I also parted ways with my previous startup I co-founded and started learning about bitcoin. by the end of 2018 I got rid of shitcoins and went bitcoin only
* my budgeting story
  * I was apprehensive about running budget before early 2018. this is when I was approaching the end of my startup engagement, and stopped having regular inflows coming in. I started listening to Dave Ramsey show and heard hundreds of stories on how people got ruined by getting into debt. I also remembered my startup & personal experience with debt. I started zero-based budgeting in late 2017, but in 2018 I really honed into it
