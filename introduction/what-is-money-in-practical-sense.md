# What is money in practical sense?

* every human being is different from one another
* human being is both physical and non-physical (spiritual, metaphysical)
* humans due to their differences value goods and services differently, at different points in time & space
* because of that, humans trade goods and services with each other
* direct trade runs into double coincidence of wants problem
* solution to the problem is medium of exchange
* over time, certain goods emerge as better medium of exchange than others due to their salability across time, space & scale
* widely used media of exchange are money
* anything can be used as money
* valuation happens in non-physical "realm". animals do not perform valuation like humans do. so money in the context of human beings using it to exchange goods and services with one another is non-physical (spiritual, metaphysical) phenomenon
