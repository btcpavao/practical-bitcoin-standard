# What is money in practical sense?

* every human being is different from one another
* human being is both physical and spiritual. when using the word spiritual, I'm refering to aspects that are impossible to measure and define physically, like weight, height, temperature etc. Spiritual in this context means non-physical (metaphysical), qualitative, like patience, loyalty, dilligence etc. when I mention "spirits" I'm reffering to non-physical aspects in human beings that can be grown & cultivated or eliminated/diminished
* humans due to their differences value goods and services differently, at different points in time & space
* because of that, humans trade goods and services with each other. person A trades with B, because it values what B has more than what A has, and B values what A has more than B has. so after the exchange, they both value things they now have more than before the exchange.
* direct trade runs into double coincidence of wants problem. A wants what B has, but B wants what C has. so A tries to exchange what it has with C, only to exchange that with B.
* solution to the problem is medium of exchange. anything a person acquires with the intention of trading it for something they actually want to use/consume is medium of exchange.&#x20;
* over time, certain goods emerge as better medium of exchange than others due to their salability across time, space & scale
* widely used media of exchange are money
* anything can be used as money, but some things perform better at the function of money
* it's important to understand that all valuation happens by our spiritual part, there is nothing inherent in physical objects that can be measured as valuable. how we value things stems from our spiritual makeup (the totality of all our non-pyhsical aspects)
* animals do not perform valuation like humans do. so money in the context of human beings using it to exchange goods and services with one another is spiritual phenomenon
* this guide is about wisdom on how to build our spiritual makeup in aspects of exchange so our relationship with other people can generate more value for everyone
* spiritual makeup we are making can be compared to growing a tree that has three parts: roots (zero based budgeting), trunk & branches (becoming\&staying debt free) and leaves & fruits (establishing giving practice). we can also compare it to constructing a building, where understructure (foundation) is zero based budgeting, plinth (base) is becoming\&staying debt free, and superstructure (visible part of the building) is establishing giving practice
* first: zero-based budgeting practice is how we get full control over our money by deciding on it's opportunity cost and controlling it in the dimension time.
* second: becoming and staying debt free is about eliminating wasteful (misjudged valuations) outflows by eliminating credit spending and replacing it with cash spending. this stops the growth of spirit of slavery and restlessness and starts growth of spirit of freedom and peace. by doing this, our spiritual makeup gets solid foundation that will replace confusion about money with clarity, and prepare us for the third step.
* third: establishing giving practice is about increasing our inflows. practicing this will grow the spirit of generosity and stop the growth of spirit of stinginess, which will increase opportunities to grow our inflows.
