# During Periods Of Higher Volatility, Increase The Frequency Of Purchasing Power Reconciliation

"But bitcoin is too volatile!" you'll hear someone say. "So, auto-DCA is how you should grow your stack."

Many well-intentioned bitcoiners recommend, especially to newcomers, adopting a "stacking sats" mentality. Ideally, they suggest that newcomers set up an automatic "dollar-cost averaging" (DCA) plan by deciding on two fixed elements: the amount they wish to invest (for example, $50) and a recurring time period (say, every month).&#x20;

By doing so, you can "set it and forget it," you are buying Bitcoin regularly, whether the price is increasing or decreasing, thus averaging out the fluctuations. This strategy has indeed outperformed doing the same into other popular savings instruments like investing in stock indexes, bonds, real estate, and precious metals.

Nonetheless, this strategy has several risks that are rarely discussed, and I'll list them here:

**1. You will experience feeling of greed (FOMO, fear of missing out) in a bull market.**&#x20;

When the true Bitcoin bull market begins, typically some time after the "halvings" due to the new marginal supply being cut in half, it's very likely auto-DCA bitcoiners will feel "underinvested" in Bitcoin. Whatever the amount of fiat they still have, they will start to fear that the Bitcoin price will run away from them.&#x20;

This is where auto-DCA services will typically market them their "smash buy" and "boost" features, which are meant to alleviate this FOMO feeling by doubling down or increasing their DCA rate. However, this can quickly lead to unwise decisions, because it is extremely difficult to resist the temptation to allocate a larger portion of one's portfolio to Bitcoin during a bull run.

Consequently, many people are compelled to let go of their auto-DCA strategy at some point and begin to attempt to time the market to compensate for the opportunity cost of not allocating more during bear market period.

This behavior is precisely the opposite of what you should be doing during a bull market. You should be focusing on planning for your future outflows and utilizing the appreciation of your Bitcoin savings, even if you feel underinvested in Bitcoin, to cover them. Essentially, during a bull market, your time should be spent using your past budgeting data to better plan for the future, rather than trying to earn more money at your job and studying Bitcoin price action to make up for the opportunity cost incurred during the bear market.

**2. Your inflows and outflows are in flux, but your strategy does not reflect this.**&#x20;

Essentially, if you begin your auto-DCA strategy with the intention of putting it on autopilot and "setting it and forgetting it," you are not taking into account changes to your future inflows and outflows.&#x20;

If your inflows increase, you'll be tempted to adjust the amount you allocate, and if they decrease, you'll want to reduce them and/or spread them out over time. Essentially, the only way to truly "set it and forget it" is to set it to a very small number that is evenly distributed across maximum time intervals. If your dollar cost average is only $1 per year, you can likely sustain this for the rest of your life, but the gains will be negligible, despite Bitcoin's volatile and intense path to becoming the dominant form of money.&#x20;

Also, a "set it and forget it" mentality is detrimental to your long-term approach to learning how to properly manage your money. You are in a constant state of change, as is your time preference and your valuation of different goods and services.
