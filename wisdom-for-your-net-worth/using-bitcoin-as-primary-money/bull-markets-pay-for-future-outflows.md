# During Periods When Purchasing Power Keeps Increasing: Look For Ways To Pay For Future Outflows

If you adhere to a strict bitcoin standard, you will unavoidably experience periods of bitcoin purchasing power appreciation, also known as bull markets. If you also maintain a zero-based budget, you'll see that your budget grows during these times and you have additional money to assign to your categories.

At this point, you should review your budgeting history and make a note of your outflows. Consider how many of these outflows you will likely repeat in the future. If you have been using zero-based budgeting for the previous six months, you can probably predict your outflows for the following six. If you use zero-based budgeting for two years, you may anticipate your outflows for the following two.

Because the future is uncertain, this act of projecting future outflows will never be precise. However, as a practice, it is still very useful because you at least have an idea of what you can expect in terms of what you find valuable to spend money on and how much it is likely to cost.

Let's say you discovered that you are spending $600 per month on your Shelter (assume in this example we are renting, and the total average cost for rent, utilities, and everything else you may spend in the Shelter category per month is $600 for the past two years).

Let's also assume that your shelter category has about $3,000 in it, which means you have about five months' worth of savings.

Let's also assume that during a bull market, your total purchasing power increases fivefold, and that, after reconciling your accounts, you discover that you have about $15,000 in the Shelter category, or about 25 months' worth of expenses, saved up.

In this situation, you should consider your future Shelter outflows and how you can pay for them now. If your rent is $450 per month, your utilities average $100 per month, and you spend an additional $50 per month on miscellaneous necessities, it would be wise to use your budget surplus to prepay for some of these expenses.

If you pay your next, say, 24 months' worth of rent in advance, your landlord will probably agree to a discount. Even though he would get $10,800 over the next 24 months if you paid $450 a month, he might accept your offer to pay him $10,800 up front and add a couple of extra months of rent so that you sign a contract for the next 29 months. You are eliminating his occupancy risk, so he would likely accept your proposal.

It's possible to optimize your utility bill as well. Look into advance payment options for utilities like electricity, water, and internet to see if you can save money by paying up front. It is worthwhile to look into this.

Examine your spending and the items you are purchasing in addition to your rent and utility bills. for instance, take a look at your annual spending on cleaning supplies. Can you buy some of these in bulk and shop around for a discount? If you do this and buy in bulk, you will probably find ways to get the same value for less money.

What ends up happening is that, by doing this, you will be able to pay for your future Shelter category outflows at a discount, all while taking advantage of Bitcoin's purchasing power appreciation. When you look around and see people getting into Bitcoin while still in debt or buying Bitcoin with leverage, you can be certain that the more intense Bitcoin purchasing power appreciation becomes during the bull market, the sharper its drop will be when the liquidation cascade starts in the bear market.

For all other categories in your budget, consider the following ideas:

**Groceries:** As you continue with your zero-based budget, you'll gain more insight into your food expenses. During the bull market, explore ways to pay for your future groceries in advance. It might be wise to purchase red meat in bulk and freeze it or pay a rancher to raise cattle that you'll only consume in 2 or 3 years. Apply similar strategies to other food expenses. The more you can think of buying food in bulk or paying for future consumables now, the better prices you'll secure and the fewer outflows you'll face during the bear market.

**Transport:** If you're saving up for a car, the bull market may provide an opportunity to purchase the car you've been planning for. Additionally, consider prepaying for your ongoing transport costs. Review your spending in the transport category and seek ways to optimize it by prepaying for future expenses.

**Clothing:** Bull markets are an ideal time to refresh your wardrobe. Also, review your budget to gain insights into your clothing spending habits, where you typically shop, and how you can make bulk purchases and prepayments. Often, you'll receive discounts when buying clothing out of season, such as shopping for summer clothing during the winter and vice versa.

**Personal Computer / Phone / Electronics:** Now is the time to consider upgrading your electronics.

**Travel / Vacation:** Take advantage of your increased purchasing power to plan for future trips. Shop around and compare prices for your planned travels in the future. Generally, paying for your trip further in advance results in lower costs. Last-minute arrangements tend to be the most expensive, so use your resources to secure deals that you can pay for now but will enjoy in the future.

Make sure to assess your total net worth and decide if you want to allocate some of your cash into your home and/or capital. Remember not to exceed one-third of your total net worth in your home and no more than one-third in capital.
