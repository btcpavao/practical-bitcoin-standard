# Ownership & Rule Of Thirds: Cash, Land & Capital

A strict Bitcoin standard requires us to reconsider the composition of our net worth, which should rely primarily on our cash balance as the dominant component.

This differs from the fiat standard, in which we are encouraged to avoid having too much liquid cash balance because it loses purchasing power over time, and instead encourages us to have a larger proportion of our net worth in non-liquid assets that can retain some of their purchasing power.

We monetized hard assets with low spatial and scale salability in order to gain higher salability over time.

Cash is the most salable and liquid component of one's net worth.

You will lack liquidity if your cash is less than one-third of your total net worth.

Little liquidity means little ability to give -> little ability to grow spirit of generosity -> little ability to grow inflows.

Little liquidity will tempt you to use your assets as collateral, which will put you back in debt and start the growth of spirit of slavery, confusion & restlessness.

This is why you should always keep at least a third of your net worth in cash. It's not a problem if you keep more than a third in cash; in fact, it can help you grow it faster because you'll have a higher Giving budget.

Consider your net worth as having an ideal balance between three distinct segments. If these segments are the right size in relation to one another, your total net worth will increase in the fastest, most sustainable, and most pleasurable manner.

The first component of your net worth is the most liquid and has the least diminishing marginal utility returns - your cash. If you adopted full Bitcoin standard, than this is the value of your bitcoin balance.

The cash balance can make up the majority of your net worth, and even if it is more than a third, it will not impair your ability to grow it.

However, there are two additional components: the value of your "land" and the value of your capital stock: If they are disproportionate to your total net worth, they may limit your ability to grow it.

When we say "land," we mean the land you own, as well as the house or real estate on it and any other durable but consumable goods that come with it. This is only considered "land" in this context if you use it for living and leisure time. If you work from home or produce something you sell using the same land/real estate where you also live, that portion of the land should be tracked as capital.

When we talk about "Capital," we mean the value of assets that you use to generate cash flow. For example, if you own a grocery store, capital would be the value of all of the equipment, inventory, and other items required to run the business. We also consider all securities you own, such as dividend-paying stocks in a company, to be Capital.

Example: You have a net worth of $500,000. Of that, $450,000 is the value of your house and 2 cars you drive in your leisure time, $40,000 is in investments (a balanced portfolio of bonds and stocks), and the last $10,000 is cash. Even if you have 20% of your budget in Giving category, this is only $2,000 out of $500,000 net worth, or 0,4% -> which means your giving transactions don't even affect growth of spirit of generosity (since your Giving is below 1,7% of your total net worth).&#x20;

This net worth balance is heavily skewed toward "land" and it's composition will substantially hinder its growth. In this case, an optimal net worth distribution would be: no more than $166k in Land, no more than $166k in Capital, and the rest in cash balance (in Bitcoin). If you want to increase the growth pace of this net worth composition, then you'd want to increase the cash balance and decrease Land and Capital, so that you can increase Giving budget above 6,7% of total net worth.
