# Assessing Your Net Worth & Balancing It

* cash (Bitcoin) purchasing power increase period -> opportunity for increasing Land & Capital (up to, but no more than third of net worth in each)
* cash (Bitcoin) purchasing power decrease period -> opportunity for decreasing Land & Capital (if they exceed a third of net worth in each) by liquidating a portion back to cash (Bitcoin)
* the goal of balancing is to have at least a third in cash (Bitcoin) at all times, in order to maximize Giving portion of the budget (we are only budgeting cash, not illiquid assets)
* example: $1m net worth that has only 5% cash (Bitcoin), will have only 0.5% - 1% in Giving portion of a budget. same net worth of $1m that has at least 33,3% in cash (Bitcoin) will have at least 3,3% to 6,6% in Giving category. same net worth that is 80% cash (Bitcoin) will have 8% to 16% in Giving category. the last one will grow at the highest rate due to highest rate of growth of spirit of generosity

You should always keep track of the items you own and their current market prices. This is especially important for more expensive items like real estate and vehicles, but it's also very useful to do it for less expensive items you own.

Your total net worth is the sum of the current market prices of all the assets you own, minus all your liabilities (debts). We've already established that the first step you should take is to run a zero-based budget, the second is to eliminate all debt, and the third is to establish a giving practice from your liquid budget. So at this point, your net worth should have zero debts.

The goal of balancing the structure of your net worth is to ensure that its growth remains at its optimal pace over time. Achieving this may sometimes require liquidating (selling) part of your Capital or Land assets, and moving that into Cash. At other times, it might mean buying Capital or Land, but only up to a value of one-third of your total net worth for each.
