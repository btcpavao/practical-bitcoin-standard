# Rules Of Thumb For Buying Vehicles

* the market price sum total of all vehicles you own (cars, motorcycles, boats, anything that has a motor inside) should not exceed above average six months of your inflows
* for example, if you make $100k per year, you should not own more than $50k total in vehicles.
* all of this is assumed you pay cash for them and calculate the cost of ownership before hand.
* when deciding wether you should buy new or used, look into cost of ownership calculation, and in particular depreciation rate for the vehicle you are considering
* keep in mind the rule of thirds: no more than a third of your net worth in your home and no more than a third in your capital. usually people use vehicles both as a consumable good and capital (they go to work with it, or use it directly to generate inflows), so the vehicle you buy will get tracked
