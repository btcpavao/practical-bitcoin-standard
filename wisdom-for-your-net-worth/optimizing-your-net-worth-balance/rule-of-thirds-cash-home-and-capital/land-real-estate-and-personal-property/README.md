# Land (Real Estate & Personal Property)

* in the context of this manual, ownership of Land consists of ownership of the actual land, real estate (building) on it, and all large durable goods on it (furniture, household appliances, art, electronics, vehicles etc).
* in this context, we define Land by it's function - we are using it for our leisure (non-labor) time
* Land can be held in multiple physical locations, or in a single one. for example, a house you live in together with two vehicles can be located in one place, and your second house, a vacation residence together with another vehicle can be located in different place. all market value of both is considered part of Land
* for example, we can have a house with all the furniture/appliances (around $190k) and a car (around $10k) that we use only for leisure, and they are combined worth around $200k. this means that Land is valued at around $200k
* however, if we use the same house and the car to do work (labor), then the total value of the Land is less than $200k. if we are using home office that is equipped with furniture/appliances used solely for work and this is around 30% of the market price of the house, and we use the car around 50% of the time to do our work, then we should account the value of our Land at $133k (70%) for a house and $5k (50%) for a car, or in total $138k.
