# When To Rent And When To Own

* difference between ownership & possession
* rent when you need to use the good for a defined period of time

We established a method for calculating and tracking the cost of ownership (depreciation, maintenance).&#x20;

This will help you see if owning something fits in with your other budget goals and net worth. If you rent something instead of buying it, you might get the same benefits without having to pay the cost of ownership.&#x20;

Renting means paying the owner for the use of something for a set period of time.&#x20;

Renting can be a very effective tool for increasing your net worth because you can get the value of something if you plan your usage over time. If you run a zero-based budget on a regular basis, you will gain a better understanding of the type of value you can derive over time by using the thing without necessarily owning it.&#x20;

Consider renting items in the "Land" and "Capital" categories.

Proper framework: "For how long do I plan to use this item, and for what purpose?" rather than "I want to own this item."&#x20;

There is such a thing as "house fever" or "car fever," a condition in which people become fixated on the idea of owning a house or a car they cannot afford (yet), and fall into the trap of going into debt to do so.&#x20;

The antidote to this is to consider renting the same house or car for a period of time so you can experience how it feels to use them, and very often you will return to rational consideration of the same house or car, especially after you perform the cost of ownership calculation.
