# Rule Of Thirds: Cash, Land & Capital

* most salable and liquid part of the net worth -> cash
* if your cash is comprises less than a third of total net worth, you will lack liquidity
* little liquidity means little ability for Giving -> means little ability for growing spirit of generosity -> means little ability for growing inflows
* little liquidity will tempt you to leverage your assets as collateral, which will bring you back into debt and start growth of spirit of slavery, confusion & restlessness
* this is why it's always best to keep at least a third of your net worth in cash. if you keep more than third in cash, it's no problem and in fact it can help you grow it faster because you'll have higher Giving budget

Consider your net worth as having an ideal balance between three distinct segments. If these segments are the right size in relation to one another, your total net worth will increase in the fastest, most sustainable, and most pleasurable manner.

The first component of your net worth is the most liquid and has the least diminishing marginal utility returns - your cash. If you adopted full Bitcoin standard, than this is the value of your bitcoin balance.

The cash balance can make up the majority of your net worth, and even if it is more than a third, it will not impair your ability to grow it.

However, there are two additional components: the value of your "land" and the value of your capital stock: If they are disproportionate to your total net worth, they may limit your ability to grow it.

When we say "land," we mean the land you own, as well as the house or real estate on it and any other durable but consumable goods that come with it. This is only considered "land" in this context if you use it for living and leisure time. If you work from home or produce something you sell using the same land/real estate where you also live, that portion of the land should be tracked as capital.

When we talk about "Capital," we mean the value of assets that you use to generate cash flow. For example, if you own a grocery store, capital would be the value of all of the equipment, inventory, and other items required to run the business. We also consider all securities you own, such as dividend-paying stocks in a company, to be Capital.

Example: You have a net worth of $500,000. Of that, $500,000 is in investments ($40,000 in a balanced portfolio of bonds and stocks), and the last $10,000 is cash. This net worth balance is heavily skewed toward "land" and will substantially hinder its growth. In this case, an optimal net worth distribution would be: up to $165k in Land, up to $165k in Capital, and the rest in cash.
