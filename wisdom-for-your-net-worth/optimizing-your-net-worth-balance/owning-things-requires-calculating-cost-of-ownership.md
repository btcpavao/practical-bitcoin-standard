# Why And How To Calculate & Track The Cost Of Ownership

* depreciation rate
* maintenance cost
* higher maintenance decreases depreciation rate
* lower maintenance increases depreciation rate

Consider the last time you paid a higher price for something. Everything you buy, own, and use depreciates over time. For example, when you buy a new phone, unbox it, and start using it, the phone loses some of its value because it is no longer brand new and unboxed - you started using it.

Items have a market-based depreciation curve. Using the same phone as an example, you can figure out how much your phone is worth when it's used after a year.

When you buy something, keep track of its depreciation in your budget. When you buy a phone for $700, you should track it as an asset worth $650 (the $50 difference is due to the fact that it is no longer brand new). After a year of use, for example, you should assess the market price of this item, i.e. how much money you can get if you liquidate it.

Assume that figure is $500; you adjust it in your budget. This is something you keep doing while using the item. You keep doing this while using the item. Remember that using the item frequently results in additional maintenance costs over time. If, after two years of use, your phone's battery loses 30% of its charge, you may choose to replace the battery rather than the phone itself.

Cars, on the other hand, require a once (or better, twice) yearly maintenance schedule to ensure they run reliably and for a longer period of time. You should budget for these ongoing maintenance costs and keep track of the depreciation of your possessions as you go.
