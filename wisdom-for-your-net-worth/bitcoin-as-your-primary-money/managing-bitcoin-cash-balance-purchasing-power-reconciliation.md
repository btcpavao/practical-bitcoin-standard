# Managing Bitcoin Cash Balance: Purchasing Power Reconciliation

We're accustomed to using fiat money as our cash balance, whether it's physical cash in our wallets or money in our checking and immediately available savings accounts. Most bitcoiners view Bitcoin as their "investment," "retirement fund," or "long-term savings" and treat it as an illiquid asset on their balance sheet.

If you've successfully implemented the previous three steps as a rock-solid foundation (running a zero-based budget for at least 180 days, eliminating all debt from your balance sheet, and establishing a regular giving practice with 10% to 20% of your budget), you should strongly consider treating Bitcoin as part of your cash balance and transitioning to the full Bitcoin standard.

When you begin using Bitcoin as part of your cash balance, you'll need to introduce one more practice into your zero-based budgeting: purchasing power reconciliation. How does this work?

Let's say you currently hold $10,000 worth of Bitcoin, which you use as your cash balance, and you don't have any other forms of money at the moment. This $10,000 in Bitcoin is all you have. Consequently, you'll allocate $10,000 to your budget categories until there's nothing left to assign.

Let's use our example of $10,000:

* $2,000 in Giving
* $2,000 in Shelter
* $2,000 in Groceries
* $2,000 in Transport
* $2,000 in Everything Else

However, what should you do if the Bitcoin exchange rate suddenly drops by 20% in a day? If your Bitcoin is suddenly worth $8,000, you need to adjust your budget categories because your budget currently has $2,000 assigned more than you actually possess.

To balance the budget, subtract $2,000 in total from your categories, which is $400 from each:

* $2,000 in Giving -> $1,600 in Giving
* $2,000 in Shelter -> $1,600 in Shelter
* $2,000 in Groceries -> $1,600 in Groceries
* $2,000 in Transport -> $1,600 in Transport
* $2,000 in Everything Else -> $1,600 in Everything Else

Now, your budget is back in balance.

What should you do if the Bitcoin exchange rate increases by 20% in a day? You perform budget reconciliation once again. Initially, you assigned $10,000 in your budget, but now you have $12,000 in the budget, meaning you have an extra $2,000 to allocate. To balance the budget, add an extra $400 to each category:

* $2,000 in Giving -> $2,400 in Giving
* $2,000 in Shelter -> $2,400 in Shelter
* $2,000 in Groceries -> $2,400 in Groceries
* $2,000 in Transport -> $2,400 in Transport
* $2,000 in Everything Else -> $2,400 in Everything Else

Once again, your budget is back in balance, with no unassigned money.

How often should you perform this reconciliation? It's up to you, but I recommend doing it frequently, especially when the change is more than a few percent in either direction. Each time you reconcile the budget this way, you have the opportunity to fine-tune the assigned amounts in different categories.
