# Categorizing Money To Decide Its Opportunity Cost

One of the major misconceptions about budgeting is the belief that it solely involves reducing spending or tracking expenses. In reality, budgeting is about allocating our money, giving it a specific plan or purpose before we actually spend it. "Planning" might be a more accurate term, or even "economizing."

Why do we need to create a budget in the first place? It's because we have to visualize and decide on our opportunity cost. Without a budget, we remain unaware of the opportunity cost of our money.

For example, let's say we currently have $5,000 in our bank account, and this is all the money we have right now. If we walk past a nice restaurant where the average dinner goes around $100, and we really want to go for it, should we? Without zero-based budgeting practice in place, our decision making process goes like this: we look at our bank account, we see $5,000 and we  glance at our bank account, we might think, "Well, $5,000 is much more than $100, so we can afford this," and proceed to dine out.&#x20;

In our example, sitting down for a $100 dinner means we incurred $100 opportunity cost on something that we haven't decided before. In other words, we spent $100 on dinner, and this means we now can't spend the same $100 on something else. This may seem like a straightforward concept, but it's challenging to truly comprehend what this means unless we allocate our money in a budget.

Returning to our initial example of having $5,000 in our bank account, let's say we created a zero based budget before deciding to spend $100 on a dinner. In this case, in our budget, we allocated a fifth of our $5,000 to our giving (we'll delve into this further in later chapters), so that's $1,000 in the Giving category.&#x20;

We allocated another fifth to our shelter costs (rent, utilities, maintenance, etc.), which amounts to $1,000 in the Shelter category. We assigned $1,000 to our Groceries category, another $1,000 to our Transport category, and the final $1,000 to "Everything Else" (which might include items like clothing, hobbies, vacations, dining out, etc.). We could do the same and break down these categories even further down, but let's keep it rather simple for this example.

Now, when deciding if we should spend $100 on dinner at this moment, we are not looking at the total amount of money we have in our bank account ($5,000) but rather, we are looking into our "Everything Else" category, which has $1,000 available. We now know that if we spend $100 on this dinner, we will have $900 left in Everything Else category. We decide we value dinner experience more than reducing $1,000 in Everything Else category down to $900, and we enjoy it. We also tip the waiter $20, and deduct that from Giving category, reducing it from $1,000 to $980. We are now left with $4,880 in our total budget. We decided we should always keep 20% of our total budget in Giving category (again, more on this later), so we need to have $976 in Giving, instead of $980. So we decide to move $4 from Giving to another category, say back to "Everything Else", which means we end up with following budget breakdown:

Total Budget: $4,880

Giving: $976

Shelter: $1,000

Groceries: $1,000

Transport: $1,000

Everything Else: $904

Let's imagine on the way home from dinner, we run short on gas in our car, and we stop at the gas station and fill up the gas tank, and pay $65. We deduct it from Transport category, drawing it down from $1,000 to $935. Our total budget now has $4,815, which means our Giving category (20% of the total budget) needs to be at $963 instead of $976. So we move $13 from Giving back to Transport, and we end up with following budget breakdown:

Total Budget: $4,815

Giving: $963

Shelter: $1,000

Groceries: $1,000

Transport: $948

Everything Else: $904

And now let's imagine a few days after, we purchase a birthday present for our friend, and pay $50. We deduct $50 from Giving category, drawing it down from $963 to $913 and we are left with $4,765 total budget. And again, we decided we should keep 20% of total budget in Giving category ($953), so we move $40 from another category, say this time Groceries to Giving. We end up with following budget breakdown:

Total Budget: $4,765

Giving: $953

Shelter: $1,000

Groceries: $960

Transport: $948

Everything Else: $904
