# Categorizing Money To Decide Its Opportunity Cost

One of the major misconceptions about budgeting is the belief that it solely involves reducing spending or tracking expenses. In reality, budgeting is about allocating our money, giving it a specific plan or purpose before we spend it. "Planning" might be a more accurate term, or even "economizing." Also, budgeting is a process of managing money, it's not a particular destination we arrive at and stay there.

So why bother doing this? Because, in order to gain full control over our money, we first have to decide it's opportunity cost. Without budgeting, our money opportunity cost remains undecided. Let's illustrate this through an example story.

Imagine we have $5,000 in our bank account, which is all the money we have at the moment. Should we go to a nice restaurant that has an average dinner price of about $100 if we really want to?

Without zero-based budgeting in place, our decision-making process is as follows: we look at our bank account, see $5,000, and may think, "Well, $5,000 is much more than $100, so we can afford this," and then go out to eat.

In our example, sitting down to a $100 dinner means we gave up $100 worth of alternatives on something we hadn't decided on before. In other words, because we spent $100 on dinner, we are unable to spend the same amount on something else. Even though this may seem like a simple idea, it can be difficult to fully understand what it means without first assigning money in our budget.

Returning to our previous example of having $5,000 in our bank account, suppose we made a zero-based budget one afternoon couple of weeks before we came across the restaurant. In this case, we put a fifth of our $5,000, or $1,000, into the Giving category of our budget. We'll talk more about this in later chapters.

A further fifth of our budget, or $1,000, was assigned to cover our housing expenses (rent, utilities, upkeep, etc.). We set aside $1,000 for groceries, $1,000 for transportation, and $1,000 for "Everything Else" (which could include things like clothing, hobbies, travel, dining out, etc.). We could further subdivide these categories, but let's keep it simple for now.

When deciding whether to spend $100 on dinner right now, we are not looking at the total amount of money in our bank account ($5,000), but rather at our "Everything Else" category, which has $1,000 available.

Here is how our budget looks like:

Total Budget: $5,000

Giving: $1,000

Shelter: $1,000

Groceries: $1,000

Transport: $1,000

Everything Else: $1,000

We now know that if we spend $100 on this dinner, we will have $900 left in the "Everything Else" category. We decide that we value the dinner experience more than retaining $1,000 in the Everything Else category, and we enjoy it. Additionally, we give the waiter a $20 tip, which we subtract from the Giving category, bringing it down from $1,000 to $980.

The remaining amount in our overall budget is $4,880. Here is how it looks now:

Total Budget: $4,880

Giving: $1,000 -> $980

Shelter: $1,000

Groceries: $1,000

Transport: $1,000

Everything Else: $1,000 -> $900

We decided to adherre to one of the three timeless money management principles, and always keep 20% of our total budget in the Giving category (again, more on this later). This means we should have $976 instead of $980 in the Giving category. So, we decide to move $4 from "Giving" to another budget category, like "Everything Else." This means that our budget now looks like this:

Total Budget: $4,880

Giving: $980 -> $976

Shelter: $1,000

Groceries: $1,000

Transport: $1,000

Everything Else: $900 -> $904

Imagine that one day after dinner, on the way to work, we stop at a gas station, fill up the tank, and pay $65 to do so. We deduct it from the Transport category, bringing it's amount down from $1,000 to $935. Our total budget is now $4,815.

Total Budget: $4,880 -> $4,815

Giving: $976

Shelter: $1,000

Groceries: $1,000

Transport: $1,000 -> $935

Everything Else: $904

We again apply timeless principle of keeping our Giving category at 20% of total budget, so we transfer $13 from Giving back to Transportation, resulting in the following budget breakdown:

Total Budget: $4,815

Giving: $976 -> $963

Shelter: $1,000

Groceries: $1,000

Transport: $935 -> $948

Everything Else: $904

Now imagine that a few days later, we spend $50 on a birthday present for a friend. We deduct $50 from the Giving category, bringing it down from $963 to $913, leaving us with a total budget of $4,765.&#x20;

Total Budget: $4,815 -> $4,765

Giving: $963 -> $913

Shelter: $1,000

Groceries: $1,000

Transport: $948

Everything Else: $904

Once more, apply timeless money management principle of keeping 20% of our total budget ($4,765) in the Giving category ($953), so we move $40 from another category, this time Groceries, to Giving. We arrive at the following budget breakdown:

Total Budget: $4,765

Giving: $913 ->$953

Shelter: $1,000

Groceries: $1000 -> $960

Transport: $948

Everything Else: $904

Then, we the day arrives when we usually pay for our rent and utilities like mobile phone bill. Our rent is $400, our mobile phone bill is $25. Let's also imagine we do our weekly groceries shopping, and spend $120 at the grocery store. Our budget now looks like this:

Total Budget: $4,765 -> $4,220

Giving: $953

Shelter: $1000 -> $600

Groceries: $960 -> $840

Transport: $948

Everything Else: $904 -> $879

Again, we calculate that our Giving category should be at 20% of total budget, which is $844 instead of $953. We move $109 from Giving to Shelter, and also decide to move $100 from Transport to Shelter, so everything is a bit more balanced. Our budget now looks like this:

Total Budget: $4,220

Giving: $953 -> $844

Shelter: $600 -> $809

Groceries: $840

Transport: $948 -> $848

Everything Else: $879

And now, let's imagine couple of days after, we get our $1,500 paycheck:

Total Budget: $4,220 -> $5,220

Giving: $844

Shelter: $809

Groceries: $840

Transport: $848

Everything Else: $879

We know we should be at 20% of the budget in Giving ($1,044), and we decide to top up the rest of the categories as well. We end up with this:

Total Budget: $5,220

Giving: $844 -> $1,044

Shelter: $809 - >$1,106

Groceries: $840 -> $1,020

Transport: $848 -> $1,020

Everything Else: $879 -> $1,030
