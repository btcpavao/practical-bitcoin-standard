# Budget Categories - Opportunity Cost Of Your Money

Why do we have to make a budget in the first place? because we have to display and decide on our opportunity cost. if you dont have a budget, you dont know what is opportunity cost of your money.

say you have 10,000 $ in your bank account, and you walk past a nice restaurant. should you sit down and spend, say $100 on a dinner? if you just take a look at your bank account, you may say, look - $10k is much more than $100, so I can afford this. and you go ahead and sit and have a dinner.

whatever you decide to spend your money on, it has opportunity cost. that is, if you spend $100 on X, you canâ€™t spend that same $100 on Y. this may seem like a straightforward idea, but you really can't understand it unless you assign your money in a budget.

so with our initial example of $10,000 in our bank account, let's say we assign a fifth of it towards our giving category (we'll talk about this more in later chapters), so that's $2,000 in Giving. Let's say we assign a fifth to our shelter costs (rent, utilities, maintenance etc), so that's $2,000 in Shelter category. Let's assign a fifth ($2,000) to our Groceries category.&#x20;

thus, we make a budget, by assigning our money to our categories. our categories are actually groups of things that are similar, and the main function of our categories is to display our opportunity cost clearly.
