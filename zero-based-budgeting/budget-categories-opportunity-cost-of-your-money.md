# Budgeting Is The Process Of Categorizing Money To Decide Its Opportunity Cost

One of the major misconceptions about budgeting is the belief that it solely involves reducing spending or tracking expenses. In reality, budgeting is about allocating our money, giving it a specific plan or purpose before we actually spend it. "Planning" might be a more accurate term, or even "economizing."

Why do we need to create a budget in the first place? It's because we have to visualize and decide on our opportunity cost. Without a budget, we remain unaware of the opportunity cost of our money.

For example, let's say we have $10,000 in our bank account, and we walk past a nice restaurant. Should we decide to sit down and spend $100 on a dinner? If we simply glance at our bank account, we might think, "Well, $10k is much more than $100, so we can afford this," and proceed to dine out. However, every decision to spend money carries an opportunity cost. In other words, if we spend $100 on X, we can't spend that same $100 on Y. This may seem like a straightforward concept, but it's challenging to truly comprehend unless we allocate our money in a budget.

Returning to our initial example of having $10,000 in our bank account, let's say we allocate a fifth of it to our giving category (we'll delve into this further in later chapters), so that's $2,000 in the Giving category. We allocate another fifth to our shelter costs (rent, utilities, maintenance, etc.), which amounts to $2,000 in the Shelter category. We assign a fifth, or $2,000, to our Groceries category, another $2,000 to our Transport category, and the final $2,000 to "Everything Else" (which might include items like clothing, hobbies, vacations, dining out, etc.). Keep in mind that this is just one way to structure a budget, and we can have more detailed categories if we prefer.

However, if we choose to spend $100 on dinner at this moment, it means we'll have only $1,900 left in our "Everything Else" category.

In essence, we create a budget by apportioning our money into various categories. These categories essentially group similar expenses, and their primary function is to clearly illustrate our opportunity costs.
