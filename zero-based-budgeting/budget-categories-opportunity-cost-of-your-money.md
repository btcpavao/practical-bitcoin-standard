# Categorizing Money To Decide Its Opportunity Cost

One of the major misconceptions about budgeting is the belief that it solely involves reducing spending or tracking expenses. In reality, budgeting is about allocating our money, giving it a specific plan or purpose before we actually spend it. "Planning" might be a more accurate term, or even "economizing."

Why do we need to create a budget in the first place? It's because we have to visualize and decide on our opportunity cost. Without a budget, we remain unaware of the opportunity cost of our money.

For example, let's say we have $5,000 in our bank account, and we walk past a nice restaurant. Should we decide to sit down and spend $100 on a dinner? If we simply glance at our bank account, we might think, "Well, $5,000 is much more than $100, so we can afford this," and proceed to dine out.&#x20;

In our example, sitting down for a $100 dinner means we incurred $100 opportunity cost on something that we haven't decided before. In other words, we spent $100 on dinner, and this means we now can't spend the same $100 on something else. This may seem like a straightforward concept, but it's challenging to truly comprehend what this means unless we allocate our money in a budget.

Returning to our initial example of having $5,000 in our bank account, let's say we created a zero based budget before deciding to spend $100 on a dinner. In this case, in our budget, we allocated a fifth of our $5,000 to our giving (we'll delve into this further in later chapters), so that's $1,000 in the Giving category.&#x20;

We allocated another fifth to our shelter costs (rent, utilities, maintenance, etc.), which amounts to $1,000 in the Shelter category. We assigned $1,000 to our Groceries category, another $1,000 to our Transport category, and the final $1,000 to "Everything Else" (which might include items like clothing, hobbies, vacations, dining out, etc.). We could do the same and break down these categories even further down, but let's keep it rather simple for this example.

Now, when deciding if we should spend $100 on dinner at this moment, we are not looking at the total amount of money we have in our bank account ($5,000) but rather, we are looking into our "Everything Else" category, which has $1,000 available. We now know that if we spend $100 on this dinner, we will have $900 left in Everything Else category. We decide we value dinner experience more than reducing $1,000 in Everything Else category down to $900, and we enjoy it. We also tip the waiter $20, and deduct that from Giving category, reducing it from $1,000 to $980.
