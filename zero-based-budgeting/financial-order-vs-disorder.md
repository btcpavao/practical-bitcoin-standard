# Financial Order Vs Disorder

The moment you create a zero-based budget, you introduce perfect order into your financial life. Every subsequent transaction you record in your budget maintains this perfect order. However, if you neglect to record a transaction, or stop maintaining your budget altogether, you initiate a process of entropy, which gradually brings disorder back into your financial life.

The good news is that when you return and start fresh once again, recreate your zero-based budget, your perfect order is instantly restored. Afterward, you simply need to sustain it by promptly entering transactions into your budget as you make them, and keep it up to date & balanced.&#x20;

As time goes on, you'll discover that there is a natural ebb and flow to this process. You may find yourself becoming increasingly irritated when you slip up and reintroduce disorder into your financial life. You will realize that you can uphold perfect order in this area with just a few minutes of attention each day, and the more time you invest in fine-tuning your budget, the wiser your financial decisions will become.

At some point, you won't want to go back to disorder.
