# Financial Order Vs Disorder

* the moment you make zero based budget with your current money, you brought perfect order into your financial life
* after that, the next time you make any type of transaction - if you enter it into your budget, you maintained perfect order. if you miss entering it, you have reduced the perfect order, and you started the process of entropy, or you started bringing disorder into your financial life again
* after a while, if you stop running your budget, the level of disorders starts to grow again.
* the good news is, that the moment you come back and make a zero based budget again, perfect order is restored. after that, you just need to maintain it by entering transactions in your budget as you are making them, and that way you'll maintain perfect order
* over time, you'll learn that there is an ebb and flow to this, and you'll start to feel more and more irritated when you slip and bring disorder into your financial life. you'll likely realize that you can keep perfect order in this area with just couple of minutes per day, and you'll start to understand that the more time you spend tuning your budget, the better money decisions you'll make.
