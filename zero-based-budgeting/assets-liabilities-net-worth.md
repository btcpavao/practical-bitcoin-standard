# Net Worth

* assets are items you own
* liabilities are debts that you owe
* your net worth is the sum of your assets minus your liabilities
* for example, if you own a house worth $100,000, a car that is worth $15,000, you have $10,000 in your bank account, and $5,000 in your investments, your assets are worth $130,000. if you also have $4,000 credit card balance, $80,000 mortgage and $10,000 car loan, you should subtract $94,000 worth of liabilities from your $130,000 worth of assets to get the net worth number, which in this case is $36,000.
* in zero based budgeting, it is essential to track your net worth over time, by tallying up the market value of your assets and subtracting your liabilities from it.
