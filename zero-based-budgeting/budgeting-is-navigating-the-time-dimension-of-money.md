# Budgeting Is Navigating The Time Dimension Of Money

* when you look at your current money situation, this is like looking at the snapshot, a photo
* however, your money exists as a continuum in time, so you need to also look at it like you are watching a video
* when you start zero based budgeting for the first time, you don't have the dimension of time yet. but if you keep practicing it for couple of months, you will start to get insight into how your money behaves over time.
* at that point, you will start use your past budgeting data in order to better plan your future. the more time you run zero based budget, the further you can look and plan for the future.
* you will start measuring your age of money, and you will understand how it increases or decreases relative to the amounts you are assigning to your categories, and when you spend it. you will learn how to increase this number, so you gain more peace and clarity
* you will learn how to use savings targets so you can gain context on not just how much money you have assigned in your categories, but also how much money you have compared to your goals. let's say that you want to save up $15,000 for a car and you currently have $2,000 in your Transport category, you can add savings target of $15,000 and then your $2,000 in Transport will mean you are at around 13% progress towards meeting your savings target.
* you will also learn to anticipate future inflows and outflows (at least those you know about now).
