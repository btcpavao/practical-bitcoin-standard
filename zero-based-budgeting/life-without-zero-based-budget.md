# Why Should We Practice Zero Based Budgeting?

* chances are, if you aren't practicing zero based budget already, that you have a certain degree of disorder in your financial life
* the goal of starting to practice zero based budgeting is to get this area of your life in perfect order. this can be done, regardless of the degree of disorder you may have at the moment, and is actually pretty simple to do.
* the moment you set up a zero based budget (and this shouldn't take more than an afternoon, at most) - you will get a very noticeable shift in your sense of being in control of your money. people usually say that after they make their first zero based budget, the feel like they have gotten about 20% raise.
* without running zero based budget, your money management is rooted in emotional instead of rational schematic. with some people this is manifested in being too "tight" with their spending, and with others as being too "loose" with their spending.&#x20;
* without zero based budget, we are operating without having clarity of opportunity cost of our money and time dimension of money. instead, when we are making purchase decisions, we are mostly comparing the momentary size of the transaction with our momentary total amount of money (a number that we often don't know in exact, but rather vague way).
* because of that, our decision making relies on how we feel about the transactions we are about to make in the moment, and we often have a sense that we "made a mistake" with our money. when we start zero-based budgeting, this sense completely vanishes.
* without zero-based budgeting, we can't really recall how we are spending our money, apart from vague number, and not too far into the past. there is a sense of vagueness about it. when we start running zero-based budget, we know exactly when, how much, on what, and where are we spending our money.
* withour zero-based budgeting, our lack of data about our spending in the past prevents us from planning our spending in the future. but when we start zero-based budgeting, as we are accruing data on our spending, we are more able to plan our future spending.
* without zero-based budgeting, we often feel affraid to take a deeper look into our finances, because we are unsure how we'll feel, and we certainly want to avoid feeling bad. when we start zero-based budgeting, we'll find this practice more and more fun on a daily basis.
* living paycheck to paycheck
* falling for getting into debt propaganda
* "I wouldn't be able to afford this without debt"
* underestimating how much spiritual energy dealing with money unwisely can drain
* not having sense of being in control
* usually higher time preference
