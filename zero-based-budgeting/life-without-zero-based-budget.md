# Life Without Zero Based Budget

* spending based on feeling, instead of thinking
* simple heuristic - is the cost of the thing I consider spending money "small" or "large" compared to how much money I have
* all spending is vague
* "I don't know where my money is going"
* approximation on how much I'm spending
* dreading looking at my money
* living paycheck to paycheck
* falling for getting into debt propaganda
* "I wouldn't be able to afford this without debt"
* underestimating how much spiritual energy dealing with money unwisely can drain
* not having sense of being in control
