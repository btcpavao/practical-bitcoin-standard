# Why Should We Practice Zero Based Budgeting?

If you never practiced zero-based budgeting, chances are you have some level of disorder in your financial life. The objective of adopting zero-based budgeting is to bring this aspect of your life into perfect order, and it's entirely achievable, regardless of the current state of disorder. In fact, it's quite straightforward.

The moment you establish a zero-based budget for the first time (which typically doesn't require more than an afternoon, at most), you'll experience a noticeable shift in your sense of control over your finances. People often report feeling like they've received a substantial raise after creating their first zero-based budget.

Without zero-based budgeting, our money management tends to be guided by emotions rather than rational decision-making. Some people become overly frugal with their spending, while others are too lenient. We lack clarity regarding the opportunity cost of our money and the time dimension of money. Instead, when making spending decisions, we typically compare the immediate transaction amount with our approximate total available funds.

Consequently, our decision-making hinges on our feelings in the moment, often leading to post-purchase regrets. When we start zero-based budgeting, this sense of regret dissapears.

Without zero-based budgeting, it's challenging to recall how we've been spending our money, apart from having a vague idea, and only for a short period. There's a general sense of uncertainty about our spending habits. Our lack of historical spending data hinders our ability to plan for future expenditures. However, when we adopt zero-based budgeting, we gain a precise understanding of when, how much, on what, and where we spend our money. As we accumulate this data, we grow better equipped to better plan our financial future.

Before zero-based budgeting, many people are apprehensive about delving deep into their finances because they're uncertain about how they'll feel, and they want to avoid negative emotions. However, once we start zero-based budgeting, we'll find the practice increasingly enjoyable on a daily basis.

Some common challenges and bad habits we get when not practicing zero-based budgeting include:

1. Living paycheck to paycheck.
2. Falling for messages promoting debt.
3. Believing we couldn't afford certain things without debt.
4. Underestimating the emotional toll of handling finances unwisely.
5. Lacking a sense of control over our finances.
6. Having a generally higher time preference (preferring immediate rewards over delayed gratification).

The more we practice zero-based budgeting, the better we'll become at it. There is no set time limit for when we ought to stop practicing it because if we continue for ten years, we will have refined our skills and will be able to make accurate plans for the next ten years.
