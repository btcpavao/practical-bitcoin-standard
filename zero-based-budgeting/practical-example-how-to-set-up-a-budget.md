# Practical Example - How To Set Up A Budget

* you can do this by hand, just using pen and paper
* you can also use software, I recommend www.youneedabudget.com
* start by counting all money you have right now, and write down how much it is and where
  * for example, open your wallet and count how much more there is, write down "Wallet: $34" (example)
  * move on to your checking account, let's say there is $2,344.42 there. write down (or enter in YNAB) "Checking: $2,344.42")
  * go on and add up all other checking & savings accounts you may have
  * finally, you will end up with a number that you need to assign to your categories
* move on to assessing the value of your assets and liabilities (if you have them). this part of your net worth is not going to be assigned to budget categories, because it's not liquid and not considered cash balance, but we are still going to track it
  * list all of your assets
  * list all of your liabilities
