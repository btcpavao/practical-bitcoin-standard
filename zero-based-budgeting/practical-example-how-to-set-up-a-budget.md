# How To Make A Zero Based Budget

* you can do this by hand, just using pen and paper
* start with simple thought exercise: how to create zero based budget with $100. use simple pen and paper. the idea is to assign $100 to three different categories. "I have $100 in total, so I'm going to assign X to category 1, Y to category 2, Z to category 3". then imagine spending $10, so you are left with $90. from which category did you spend $10? adjust that category with the new balance.
* you can also use software, I recommend [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com) (I'm using it daily since late 2017)
* start by counting all money you have right now, and write down how much it is and where
  * for example, open your wallet and count how much more there is, write down "Wallet: $34" (example)
  * move on to your checking account, let's say there is $2,344.42 there. write down (or enter in YNAB) "Checking: $2,344.42")
  * go on and add up all other checking & savings accounts you may have
  * finally, you will end up with a number that you need to assign to your categories
* move on to assessing the value of your assets and liabilities (if you have them). this part of your net worth is not going to be assigned to budget categories, because it's not liquid and not considered cash balance, but we are still going to track it
  * list all of your assets
  * list all of your liabilities
