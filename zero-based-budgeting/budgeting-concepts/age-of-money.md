# Age Of Money

* a measure of number of days between the time that you assigned money to a category and the time you spent from it
* the higher the age of money, more financial peace you have
* debt decreases age of money
* higher age of money means lower time preference
* higher age of money provides more time to research the purchase, thus making a better purchase
* you will enjoy your purchases more with higher age of money, because there was more time in building up to the purchase, planning, anticipation and more appreciation overall.
