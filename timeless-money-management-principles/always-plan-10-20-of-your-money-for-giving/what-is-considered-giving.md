# What Is Considered Giving?

* giving is any transaction for which you do not expect anything in return

When you give, you should do so without expecting anything in return. Your giving should not result in a liability on the beneficiary's balance sheet. So don't keep track of transactions from the giving category as your assets.

If the recipient of your generosity later wishes to repay it, accept it only if they insist, and make it clear that you do not expect anything in return.&#x20;

Here are some of the ways you can give: direct financial assistance, charity, gifts, tips, loans without expectation of payback, investments without expectation of return, donations, sponsorships with no contractual obligations for promotional benefits.
