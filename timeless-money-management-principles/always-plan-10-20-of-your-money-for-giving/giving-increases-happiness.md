# Giving Increases Happiness

There will always be those who have more than we do, and those who have less.

* we can compare our situation with those that have more than we do, and this is going to generate feeling of lack and envy, and will eat into our sense of happiness overall
* or we can practice giving, which will always generate that we have more than we need, and will boost our sense of happiness overall

The feeling of having and producing value that other people can benefit from is what makes us happy when we practice giving. When we give, we feel like we have something valuable to offer others, which makes us happy.

We have a deep understanding that everyone benefits from our agency in the world. We can enjoy the things we give to ourselves more when we know that we can give to others and make them happy. We can enjoy the things we give to ourselves more when we understand that we can give to others and make them happy. We begin to fully grasp the interdependence of all humans and develop a profound appreciation for one another.
