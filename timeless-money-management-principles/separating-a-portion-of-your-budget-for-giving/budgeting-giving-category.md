# Budgeting Giving Category

* I recommend having one category in your budget with the name "Giving", which you always keep at 10% to 20% of your current budgeting amount (cash balance)
* for example, if you have $10,000 in cash balance, you should assign between $1,000 up to $2,000 in your Giving category
* when you spend from your Giving category, for example if you buy a gift worth $100, you should subtract that from Giving category which will mean it will go down to $900 or $1,900 respectively.
* however, you should also rebalance the amount you assign to Giving category when you make transactions from other categories, because Giving category needs to be 10% to 20% of your cash balance.&#x20;
* So if after purchasing the gift, you go ahead and pay your rent and utilities for the month (say, $600), in this situation, your total cash balance went from $10,000 to $9,300 ($100 deducted from Giving, and $600 deducted from Shelter). this means your new Giving category target should be 10% to 20% of $9,300, meaning it should be anywhere between $930 and $1,860.
* you will realize that by calculating your Giving category this way, you can't really deplete it completely, unless you spend all of your money at the same time. this is intentional, because your giving budget needs to be there for you always, and it needs to adjust according to your current cash balance
