# How to give?

* smaller but more often is better then larger less often
* never let a full year go by without making a single transaction from Giving category
* family first, friends second, acquintances third, local community fourth etc. the closer people are to your circle, the higher priority
* if the giving is charity driven, the best way is for the beneficiary not to know that you are benefactor. you always need to consider the dignity of the benefactor
* if above is not possible (meaning, beneficiary will know that you are the benefactor), the second best way is to give as an investment in their business (but no expectations of return on your end)
* third is to offer no interest loan, no expected date of return (and no expectations of return on your end)
* there is no goal to arrive at in this practice, it's a lifetime journey you should continue doing and get better & more wise about it over time
