# Giving Money Benefits Giver More Than Recipient

* separate between 10% to 20% of the liquid part of your budget and assign it to Giving category
* do this even if the intention is to derive benefit for yourself only
* do this because it is going to build spirit of generosity in you
* spirit of generosity will lead to increased income
* if you continue keeping 10% to 20% of your budget in Giving category even after your income has grown, you will have larger Giving category
* this will increase spirit of generosity even more, which will lead to even more income
* don't stop this practice once you start, and your income will keep growing
