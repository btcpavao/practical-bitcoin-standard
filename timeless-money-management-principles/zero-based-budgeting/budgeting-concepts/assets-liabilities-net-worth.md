# Net Worth



Your net worth is the sum of your assets minus your debts (liabilities).

For example, if you own a $100,000 house, a $15,000 car, $10,000 in your bank account, and $5,000 in investments, your assets are worth $130,000. If you also have a $4,000 credit card balance, a $80,000 mortgage, and a $10,000 car loan, you should subtract your $94,000 liabilities from your $130,000 assets to get your net worth, which is $36,000 in this case.

Net worth can be tracked over time.
