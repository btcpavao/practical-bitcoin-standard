# Using Things Paid With Credit Diminishes Satisfaction

* the time you put towards working to buy something with savings, increases the satisfaction with the thing when you buy it
* this is because we love things we invest in. it's our time investment in the thing that makes it more valuable to us
* imagine a scenario where you buy a car after saving up for it for 7 years. during these 7 years, you were diligently separating some of your cash flow towards this savings goal, and you also got time to research all you could about the car and it's alternatives
* the fact that you waited 7 years to buy this car will make it that much more enjoyable and feel like you've upgraded from whatever else you were using as substitute before you bought it
* the time it took you to save up for it allowed you to research everything about it.
* by buying it with cash, you will be able to get a discount on the price
* also, when you start using it, you will take good care of it, by allocating appropriate money to cover the cost of ownership
* all of this will permeate into overall experience of owning the car
* now compare this to a situation where you buy the car with credit now, and pay it off over the next 7 years in the future.
* first - you are not going to have the feeling of building up towards the purchase of the car, the anticipation and time you put into saving for it. this is immidiately going to be drastically different feeling than if you bought it by saving
* but when you start using the car, you actually start paying for it and building up investment of your time in it. now the feeling of liking the car because you are working for it and paying for it in installments starts going up, but it's counteracted with the feeling of discovering some faults the car has, that you didn't have time to research and look into because you jumped into debt quickly before hand.
* you also don't have sense of full ownership yet, so you don't really take the best care of the car. this just increases the cost of ownership in regards to the depreciation curve, and you start avoiding looking into the actual market value of the car compared to your overall debt balance for it (it may be underwater already).
* after a while you end up with a car that is slowly becoming a burden instead of joy.
