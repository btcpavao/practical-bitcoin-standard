# Debt And Bitcoin

Having debt and Bitcoin on your balance sheet at the same time is extremely dangerous for your net worth management. Staying in debt during Bitcoin bull runs will make you FOMO into more debt to increase your Bitcoin exposure. Staying in debt during Bitcoin bear markets will make you panic into decreasing your Bitcoin exposure to stay solvent and not go bankrupt on your debt.

The only right way is to eliminate all of your debt first, and then start accumulating Bitcoin.
