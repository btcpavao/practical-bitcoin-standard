# When You Get Into Fiat Debt, You Indirectly Steal Purchasing Power From Poor



* whenever you take out a loan from a bank, new money is created
* when you pay back the loan, money is destroyed
* the only reason why this system works is the violent coercion from the state which mandates using fiat money in the marketplace through legal tender laws, tax collection in  fiat money, and mandates that large financial institutions hold certain amount of government bonds in their portfolio
* this effectively means that the only reason the debt is monetized around the world is the coercion of the state
* so when you get into debt through any of the fiat licensed institutions, you are effectively leveraging the state coercive power to transfer your credit risk to the holders of the fiat money
* your credit risk will ultimately manifest in wide price inflation
* price inflation is the most regressive form of taxation, and mostly affects the poorest people amongst us. poor people have majority of their net worth in liquid fiat cash, as compared to wealthy people who for the most part have only small amount of their net worth in liquid cash.
