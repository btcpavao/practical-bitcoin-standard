# Spirit of Clarity

* this spirit manifests because every time you purchase something, you do it fully aware of your current valuation of the item. if you value it more than the money you need to pay for it, you will acquire it. if not, you won't.
* you always know the subjective value items you own have for you
* the moment you value a thing you own less than the money you can get for it, you will liquidate it
* by keeping track of the inventory of all items you own, and liquidating them at the moment you don't value them more than someone, you will be able to make sound decisions on what to own and for how long
