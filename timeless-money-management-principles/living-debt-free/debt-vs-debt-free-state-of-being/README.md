# Debt Vs Debt-Free State Of Being

Spending credit taints a person's psychospiritual makeup with the spirit of slavery. Spiritually, the borrower is a slave of the lender. Slavery here is defined as not having freedom on deciding how to utilize time. There is the extent to which this freedom is reduced, and it's measured in the amount of time you will need to allocate for servicing the debt for the duration of the debt.&#x20;

people can intuintively sense this spirit in you by the way you approach spending money, your work and your leisure time. the deeper and longer in debt you are, you will have less leisure time, your work will be more stressful, and your money spending more constrained.&#x20;

this aura will repel inflow opportunities that otherwise may arise, because spirit of slavery emanates subtle energy of desperation, which other people can sense. people don't like to deal with desperate people, because they feel guilt if they don't do something to help them out. the antidote for this is establishing a giving practice. if a person doesn't have well established giving practice, when they sense desperation coming from spirit of slavery of another person, they will naturally look for ways to avoid or minimize economic interaction with that person.

there are two distinct states of spiritual makeup: one is "In Debt" and the other is "Debt Free". they both cultivate growth of different spirits: when you are in debt you cultivate spirit of slavery, and when you are debt free you cultivate spirit of freedom

there is no such thing as "good" or "bad" debt, but there is a precise psychospiritual mechanism that one vs the other state cultivates

it may be helpful to imagine your soul like a soil, with seeds of different spirits inside that are kind of laying there, dormant. when a seed gets watered (in this metaphor, watering the seed would be akin to a certain practice), it sprouts and starts to grow. if it is continually watered, it grows bigger, stronger, develops roots, grows a trunk and ultimately bears fruit.

when you owe money (i.e. you have liability on your balance sheet), this starts to "water" the seed of spirit of slavery

when you have zero liabilities, i.e. you don't owe money to anybody, this starts to "water" the spirit of freedom
