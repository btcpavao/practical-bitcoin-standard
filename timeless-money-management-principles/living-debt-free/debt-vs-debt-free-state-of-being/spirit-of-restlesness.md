# Spirit of Restlesness

* you have a constant pressure at the back of your mind on how you are going to make the next payment
* since your debt repayment is highest priority, the stability of your source of income is paramount
* if your source of income for any reason get's into financial trouble - you are affected. wether you are consciously aware of this or not, it is going to contribute to restlesness
* spirit of restlesness spills over to other people around you
* it produces impatience
* it prevents good sleep and affects health negatively
* it reduces overall capacity for earning money
