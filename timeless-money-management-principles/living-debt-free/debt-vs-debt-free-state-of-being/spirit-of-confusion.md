# Spirit of Confusion

* the main source of confusion is your decision to spend from uncertainty of the future
* humans can only make valuations in the present, and they can be informed from the certainty of their past valuations
* when you spend from the future, you are entering into a confused state about your valuation of the thing you bought. you can't really compare the value of future amount of money with future valuation of the future state of the thing you bought in the present
* confusion ends up increasing the cost of ownership of the thing you bought, because you are less likely to take care of it properly
* you are not taking care of it properly because in a way it's not really yours until you pay it off
* but during the payoff time, your valuation of the thing can change, and you may value the money you are paying for it more than the thing
* on the other hand, if you try to liquidate the thing and pay off the debt, you may have a situation where the depreciation of the thing combined with your reduced ongoing maintenance costs increased the cost of ownership so much that you are not able to pay off the debt fully by just liquidating the thing. in other words, you are "underwater", the thing that you are now trying to liquidate is valued less then your debt.
* spirit of confusion will make it harder for you to realistically mark to market the value of the thing you purchased with debt. you'll want to avoid looking at it altogether, because you'll feel it's going to add to the overall confusion.
