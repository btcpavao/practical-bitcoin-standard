# Increase Spirit Of Peace & Clarity By Aging Your Money

The older your money, the more financial peace you have. Debt reduces the age of money. Higher age of money equals lower time preference. A higher age of money allows for more time to research the purchase, resulting in a better purchase. With a higher age of money, you will enjoy your purchases more because there was more time spent planning, anticipating, and overall appreciation.
