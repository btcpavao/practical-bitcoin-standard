# Paying With Credit Increases The Cost Of Ownership

* we always take better care of the things we own outright
* taking less care for the thing you bought with debt means you are delaying maintenance costs into the future, and this will just increase them later on
* due to this effect, depreciation curve on the thing you bought with debt will be steeper than the one you own outright and properly maintain in the best condition possible
* even worse is that for the duration of the debt you are not really feeling as owner of the thing, but when you finally pay off the debt on the thing, it is depreciated so much that owning it doesn't really feel as good as it would if you were to buy it with savings
