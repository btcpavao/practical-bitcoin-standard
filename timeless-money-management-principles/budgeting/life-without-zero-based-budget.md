# Why Practice Budgeting?

One of the major misconceptions about budgeting is the belief that it solely involves reducing spending or tracking expenses. In reality, budgeting is about allocating our money, giving it a specific plan or purpose before we spend it. "Planning" might be a more accurate term, or even "economizing." Also, budgeting is a process of managing money, it's not a particular destination we arrive at and stay there.

This manual will focus specifically on the practice of zero-based budgeting. When used in this context, "zero-based" means that we assign all of our money to each budget category until there is no more money to be assigned. For example, if we have $1,000 in our budget and only assign $200 to a category, we still have $800 to assign. The budget is not zero-based until we decide how to assign the remaining $800 (to which category/categories).

So why bother doing this?

If you never practiced budgeting, chances are you have some level of disorder in your financial life. So our first objective is to bring this aspect of your life into perfect order, and it's entirely achievable, regardless of the current state of disorder. In fact, it's quite straightforward.

The moment you establish your budget for the first time (which typically doesn't require more than an afternoon, at most), you'll experience a noticeable shift in your sense of control over your finances. People often report feeling like they've received a substantial raise after creating their first budget.

Every subsequent transaction you record in your budget maintains this perfect order and sense of being in control over your money. However, if you neglect to record a transaction, or stop maintaining your budget altogether, you initiate a process of entropy, which gradually brings disorder back into your financial life.

The good news is that when you return and start fresh once again, recreate your budget, perfect order is instantly restored. Afterward, you simply need to sustain it by promptly entering transactions into your budget as you make them, and keep it up to date & balanced.&#x20;

As time goes on, you'll discover that there is a natural ebb and flow to this process. You may find yourself becoming increasingly irritated when you slip up and reintroduce disorder into your financial life. You will realize that you can uphold perfect order in this area with just a few minutes of attention each day, and the more time you invest in fine-tuning your budget, the wiser your financial decisions will become.

At some point, you won't want to go back to disorder.

Without budgeting, our money management tends to be guided by emotions rather than rational decision-making. Some of us become overly frugal with our spending, while others become too lenient, and we might say, sloppy.&#x20;

This is because without a budget, we lack clarity regarding the opportunity cost and time dimension of our money. So, when making spending decisions, we typically compare the immediate transaction amount with our approximate total available funds.

Consequently, our decision-making hinges on our feelings in the moment, often leading to post-purchase regrets. When we start budgeting, this sense of regret dissapears.

Without budgeting, it's challenging to recall how we've been spending our money, apart from having a vague idea, and only for a short period. There's a general sense of uncertainty about our spending habits. Our lack of historical spending data hinders our ability to plan for future expenditures.&#x20;

When we adopt budgeting, we gain a precise understanding of when, how much, on what, and where we spend our money. As we accumulate this data, we grow better equipped to better plan our financial future.

Before budgeting, many of us are apprehensive about delving deep into our money situation, because we are uncertain how we'll feel. We want to avoid feeling bad about our money situation. However, once we start budgeting, we'll find the practice increasingly enjoyable on a daily basis.

Some common challenges and bad habits we get when not practicing budgeting include:

1. Living paycheck to paycheck.
2. Falling for messages promoting debt.
3. Believing we couldn't afford certain things without debt.
4. Underestimating the emotional toll of handling money unwisely.
5. Lacking a sense of control over our money.
6. Having a generally higher time preference (preferring immediate rewards over delayed gratification).

The more we practice budgeting, the better we'll become at it. There is no set time limit for when we ought to stop practicing it because if we continue for ten years, we will have refined our skills and will be able to make accurate plans for the next ten years.
