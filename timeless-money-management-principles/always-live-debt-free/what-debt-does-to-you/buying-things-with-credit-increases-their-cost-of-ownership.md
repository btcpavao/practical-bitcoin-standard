# Debt Increases The Cost Of Ownership

We take better care of things we own outright.

Taking less care of a debt-purchased item means deferring maintenance costs into the future, which will only increase them later.

Because of this effect, the depreciation curve on something you bought with debt will be steeper than the one you own outright and properly maintain in the best condition possible.

Even worse, you don't really feel like you own the thing for the duration of the debt, but when you finally pay it off, it has depreciated so much that owning it doesn't feel as good as it would if you bought it with savings.
