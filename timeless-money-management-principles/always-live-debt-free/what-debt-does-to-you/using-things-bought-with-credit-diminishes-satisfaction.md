# Debt Decreases Ownership Satisfaction

The time you put into working to save for something increases your satisfaction with the item when you buy it.

This is because we care about the things we invest in. Our time investment in something makes it more valuable to us.

Consider the following scenario: you buy a car after saving for it for seven years. You were carefully setting aside a portion of your income for this savings goal over the course of these seven years, and you also had time to learn everything you could about the car and alternatives.

The fact that you waited seven years to buy this car will make it more enjoyable and make you feel like you've upgraded from whatever you were driving before you bought it.

You were able to research everything about it because of the time it took you to save up for it.

You were able to get a price reduction by paying cash.

Additionally, when you began using it, you took care of it by assigning enough money to cover the cost of ownership.

All of this influenced the overall ownership experience.

Now compare this to a situation in which you buy the car on credit now and pay it off over the next 7 years.

First and foremost, you will not have the sense of building up to the purchase of the car, the anticipation and time you put into saving for it. This is going to give you a completely different feeling than if you saved up for it.

However, once you begin using the car, you begin paying for it and investing your time in it. Now the feeling of liking the car increases because you are working for it and paying for it in installments, but it is offset by the feeling of discovering some flaws in the car that you didn't have time to research and investigate because you jumped into debt quickly before hand.

You also don't have a full sense of ownership yet, so you don't take good care of the car. This simply raises the cost of ownership in terms of the depreciation curve, and you begin to avoid looking into the actual market value of the car in relation to your overall debt balance for it (it may already be underwater).

After a while, you end up with a car that is gradually becoming a burden rather than a joy.
