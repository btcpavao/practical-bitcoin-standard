# Outflows Are Increased Because Of Interest, Opportunity Cost & Misallocation

* spending credit is always more expensive than spending cash, because humans have positive time preference, meaning: people always value present money more than future money. the cost of spending future money is expressed in the interest rate
* the price you pay over the duration of the debt has two opportunity cost sources: the amount you would save by getting a discount if you paid for the same thing with cash plus the total interest you will pay over the duration of the debt
* your opportunity cost should be calculated in purchasing power appreciation if it was saved in bitcoin during the duration of the debt
* there is a third, often missed cost of spending credit: opportunity cost of financial decisions made influenced by spirit of slavery instead of spirit of freedom. for example, your next 30 years of inflows & outflows and decisions about your net worth balance will look completely different with completely different outcomes in case a) where you are saddled with 50% of your net worth in liabilities, and b) where you have zero liabilities.
