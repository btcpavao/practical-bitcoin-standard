# Spirit Of Freedom

A place where you are fully in control of how you utilize your ultimate resource: time.

By staying debt-free, the spirit of freedom grows with time.

View it as an asset, akin to a tree that flourishes and bears more fruit as it grows, as long as you remain debt-free. It needs time to grow. When you enter a state of debt, the growth of your spirit of freedom stops, and it resumes when you get out of debt.

The more spirit of freedom you have, the greater your ability to decide how to utilize your time.

If your spirit of freedom is one year old, you have the ability to decide how you spend your time for up to a year. If it's "ten years old," you can determine how to allocate your time for the next ten years.

The longer you stay out of debt, the better you become at understanding and utilizing your remaining time in the future.
