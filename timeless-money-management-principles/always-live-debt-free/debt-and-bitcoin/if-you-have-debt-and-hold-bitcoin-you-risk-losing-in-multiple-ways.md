# If You Have Debt And Hold Bitcoin, You Risk Losing In Multiple Ways

You may believe that you are profiting from the difference between the interest rate you are paying on debt and the annual growth rate of bitcoin.

However, if you believe this, you are overlooking or forgetting several issues.&#x20;

The first is the opportunity cost of your stress as a result of this action.&#x20;

The second is the increased cost of ownership because you have less money for maintenance of the item you purchased with debt, resulting in a higher real rate of depreciation.&#x20;

And the third is the opportunity cost of not being able to increase the spirit of generosity and income.

Even though your interest rate is a fixed percentage, your perception of the value of the item that you financed may shift over time. When your initial assessment of a product is off, you may end up with something you don't like but are stuck paying for anyway.

You might not stick to your plan if bitcoin gets too volatile. If it rises and you haven't paid off your debt, you may feel compelled to take on even more debt in an effort to "chase the pump." The added pressure of having to keep making payments on an asset you can no longer afford means that you'll be less happy with your possessions than you would be if you didn't have any debt to worry about.
