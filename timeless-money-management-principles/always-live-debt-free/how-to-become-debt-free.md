# How To Become Debt-Free?

We can usually read and hear about three different debt-reduction strategies.

The first is the debt snowball method, in which you order your debts from smallest to largest and make the minimum payment on all but the smallest, where you pay the most. The goal is to build momentum by paying off small debts first, so you can get "the kick" and be more motivated to pile on the next in line. If you only have a choice between these three methods, I'd go with this one.

The second method is the debt avalanche method, in which you order your debts by the size of their interest rates and pay the minimum on all but the debt with the highest interest rates, where you pay the most. Just mathematically speaking, this will be the quickest way out of debt out of the three. The disadvantage is that it is the most difficult to maintain psychologically.

The third method is debt consolidation, which involves taking on new debt with a single interest rate and duration to pay off all of your existing debts with different maturities and interest rates. This is the easiest, but the main drawback is that you will probably want to choose a longer maturity term for your debt because you will psychologically prefer to have a smaller monthly payment amount. This will keep you in debt for the longest period of time.

My advice is to sell off whatever assets you can and pay off your debt as soon as possible because you will benefit most from spending the least amount of time in debt. This is because, after that, you can proceed to the next phase, which will increase your inflows, by allocating 10% to 20% of your budget to the Giving category.

If you are not convinced about it, I would advise you to continue managing your budget and attempting to make ends meet while retaining your Bitcoin. You can try any of the three mentioned strategies to speed up the process, but ultimately I think the volatility of Bitcoin will eventually force you to decide to simply pay off your debt for good, even if it means big change in your lifestyle.
