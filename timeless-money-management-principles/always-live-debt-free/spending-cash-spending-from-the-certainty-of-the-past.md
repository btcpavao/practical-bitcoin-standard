# Debt-Free Means Spending From The Certainty Of The Past

Spending money you already have means you are fully aware of its opportunity cost (because your money is already budgeted).

You will always receive a better deal when paying with cash for whatever you are purchasing than when using credit, and you will avoid paying the interest rate over time. When you add up these two, you should consider their future purchasing power if you were to save them in Bitcoin.

For instance, if you see something with a $5,000 manufacturerâ€™s suggested retail price (MSRP, or sticker price) and decide to buy it with cash, you may be able to negotiate the price down to around $4,500. If, on the other hand, you were to finance it over, say, five years, you would pay about $6,000 total, or $100 a month. But the $1,500 price difference should be adjusted for it's opportunity cost if it were saved in Bitcoin over 5 years. We are still talking about an annual compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 15%, even if we assume that Bitcoin will continue to grow at a rate ten times slower than its historical trend.

And this is without even considering the value of your potential to increase your inflows as a result of not growing a spirit of slavery, restlessness, and confusion, but rather a spirit of freedom, peace, and clarity over the time you'd otherwise be in debt.
