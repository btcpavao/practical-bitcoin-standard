# Be Grateful For The Opportunity To Give

* whenever we make a transaction from our Giving category, it is boosting our spirit of generosity
* we want to always understand that by doing this, we may or may not actually produce a benefit to the recipient. but 100% of the time, we are going to produce benefit for our spiritual schematic - which will increase in spirit of generosity
* thus we are not even looking for recognition in form of "thank you" from the recipient, let alone expect anything in return. in fact, we should feel gratitude that we even had the opportunity to make this giving transaction
* our spirit of generosity will keep growing every time we make a transaction from Giving category, and if we keep being grateful for the opportunity to do so, we'll feel more contentment about our net worth, and overall optimism about our future
