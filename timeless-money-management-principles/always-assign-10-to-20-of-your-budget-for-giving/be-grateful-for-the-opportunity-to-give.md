# Be Grateful For The Opportunity To Give

Our spirit of generosity is increased each time we make a transaction from our Giving category.

We should always keep in mind that this action may or may not result in a benefit for the recipient. But always and without fail, we will generate benefit for our spiritual blueprint, leading to a growth in spirit of generosity.

As a result, we are not even looking for a "thank you" from the recipient, let alone seeking anything in return. In fact, we should be grateful that we had the opportunity to practice this act of giving.

Every time we make a transaction from the Giving category, our generosity will continue to grow, and if we remain thankful for the chance to do so, we'll feel more satisfied with our net worth and generally more optimistic about the future.
