# Giving Increases Risk Tolerance

* in our professional life, we will constantly come across opportunities where we can take risks that have favorable rewards attached to them. in other words, we have many opportunities with positive risk/reward ratio in them
* when we regularly practice giving, we naturally increase our overall risk tolerance, and can take on higher risks that have higher reward attached to them
* this is because we are already used to spend money without expecting anything in return, apart from our spirit of generosity growing
* so in this context, even when we make an investment that had favorable risk/return ratio, but we didn't make the return in that particular case, we are still benefiting and don't suffer from sunk cost fallacy
