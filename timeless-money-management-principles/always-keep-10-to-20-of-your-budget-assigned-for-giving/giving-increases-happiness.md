# Giving Increases Happiness

* There will always be those who have more than we do, and those who have less.
* It is our choice on which we will focus.
* happiness comes from the fact that by practicing giving, we feel like we have and can generate value that other people can receive
* we deeply know that our agency in the world is for the benefit of everyone
* when we know that we can give to others and make others happy, we can have more enjoyment of the things we give to ourselves.
* we start to deeply understand interconnectedness of humans, and appreciate other people more and more
