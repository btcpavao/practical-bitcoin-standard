# Keep At Least A Third Of Your Net Worth In Liquid Budget For Giving

* on a gold standard, keeping a lot of liqudity on hand in gold meant high cost of storage, security, insurance and transfer.
* on a fiat standard, keeping a lot of liquidity on hand in fiat cash (physical paper notes or digitally in bank accounts) means losing a lot of purchasing power over time due to increase in fiat money supply & risk of censorship

You need a lot of liquidity in your net worth to avoid feeling like your giving transactions are too difficult.

To put it another way, hold onto at least one-third of your net worth in cash (we'll go over how to use Bitcoin as your primary money and cash balance later).

This is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity to carry out giving transactions without hesitation.
