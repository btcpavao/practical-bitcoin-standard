# Maintain Balance in Your Net Worth Composition

### Understand the Difference Between Three Types of Goods: Monetary, Consumption, and Production

Economic goods can have three use cases: 1) monetary - medium of exchange, 2) consumption, and 3) production (capital). There is nothing inherent in the goods that defines their use. In other words, how we use a good determines its functional definition. Furthermore, we can use the good for two or even all three functions at the same time.

Let's use the example of an economic good: a house. Depending on how we use the house, this economic good may be a monetary, consumption, or capital (production) good. Let's look at an example in which we use our house for more than just personal living space during our free time (which would be using it as a consumption good).

Assume we set up a home office or use our garage for income-generating activities. Or suppose we rent out a spare room or apartment in our house that we don't use for living. In all of these cases, the house is considered both a consumption and a capital good.

Let's say our plan is to sell this house at some point in the future. If we purchase the house with the intention of selling it later and we don't plan to live in it or use it for any kind of production, we are effectively using the house as a monetary good.

We can also use the house exclusively for one purpose at a time. For example, if we only use this house for income-generating purposes (such as renting it out), it is considered a capital good.

We are using a house as a monetary good if we buy it with the sole purpose of selling it in the future, without any intention of living in it, renting it, or engaging in any other income-generating activities with it.

We can also divide goods according to their spatial and temporal characteristics. Spatial characteristics are divided into movable and immovable. Temporal characteristics are divided into durable and non-durable (perishable).

The main point is to always have enough cash on hand in your net worth so that you can grow it in the best way possible. If you adopt a full Bitcoin standard, Bitcoin is going to be a part of your cash balance, so you will practice zero-based budgeting with it.

The best way to grow net worth overall is to follow the rule of thirds and make sure that no more than a third of our assets are in Land and no more than a third are in Capital.

Increase in cash (Bitcoin) purchasing power -> opportunity to increase Land & Capital (up to, but no more than, one-third of net worth in each).

Period of decreasing cash (Bitcoin) purchasing power -> opportunity for decreasing Land & Capital (if they exceed a third of net worth in each) by liquidating a portion back to cash (Bitcoin).

The goal of balancing is to always have at least one-third in cash (Bitcoin) to maximize the Giving portion of the budget (we are only budgeting cash, not illiquid assets).

For example, a $1 million net worth with only 5% cash (Bitcoin) will have only 0.5% - 1% ($5,000 to $10,000) in the Giving portion of a budget. The same $1 million net worth that has at least 33.3% in cash (Bitcoin) will have at least 3.3% to 6.7% ($33k to $66k) in the Giving category. The same net worth of 80% cash (Bitcoin) will have 8% to 16% ($80k to $160k) in the Giving category. The last one will grow at the fastest rate due to the fastest rate of growth of the spirit of generosity.

You should always keep track of the items you own and their current market prices. This is especially important for more expensive items like real estate and vehicles, but it's also very useful to do it for less expensive items you own.

Your total net worth is the sum of the current market prices of all the assets you own, minus all your liabilities (debts). We've already established that the first step you should take is to run a zero-based budget, the second is to eliminate all debt, and the third is to establish a giving practice from your liquid budget. So at this point, your net worth should have zero debts.

The goal of balancing the structure of your net worth is to ensure that its growth remains at its optimal pace over time. Achieving this may sometimes require liquidating (selling) part of your Capital or Land assets and moving that into Cash. At other times, it might mean buying Capital or Land, but only up to a value of one-third of your total net worth for each.

Your net worth composition will also change with changes in Bitcoin purchasing power.

### The Fiat Standard Way: Cash Is Trash

In the Fiat standard, the more liquid cash we keep on our balance sheet, the more purchasing power we lose over time, due to an increase in the money supply through fiat debt creation.

This is why most people are used to keeping as little cash on hand as possible.

### The Bitcoin Standard Way: Cash Is King

Keeping your cash balance in Bitcoin increases its purchasing power over time while maintaining high liquidity.

### Keep No More Than a Third of Your Net Worth in Consumption Goods

Ownership of consumption assets, as defined in this manual, includes ownership of the land, real estate (buildings) on it, and all large durable goods on it (furniture, household appliances, art, electronics, vehicles, etc.).

We define consumption assets by their function: we use them for our leisure (non-labor) time. We can also think of consumption assets as a collection of all our goods (more or less durable, movable, or immovable) that we consume. We track the value of consumption assets if each of them represents more than 1/60 of our total net worth.

For example, we may have a house with all the furniture/appliances (approximately $190k) and a car (approximately $10k) that we only use for leisure, both of which are worth approximately $200k. This means that the land is worth around $200k.

However, if we use the same house and car for labor, the total value of the land is less than $200k. If we have a home office equipped with furniture/appliances used solely for work, constituting around 30% of the market price of the house, and we use the car around 50% of the time for work, we should account for the value of our land at $133k (70%) for the house and $5k (50%) for the car, for a total of $138k.

### Non-Monetary Goods Cost of Ownership Tracking

First and foremost, do not exceed the rule of thirds. Large durable goods are part of your net worth's consumption and/or capital (production) segments. Before purchasing, calculate the total cost of ownership. After purchasing, regularly update the value of the consumption goods and/or capital to keep track of the depreciation rate.

When deciding whether to buy new or used, consider the cost of ownership calculation as well as the depreciation rate for the vehicle you are considering.

Remember the rule of thirds: allocate no more than one-third of your net worth to consumption goods and no more than one-third to capital (production goods). People typically use vehicles as both consumption goods and capital (they drive to work with it or directly use it to generate inflows), so the vehicle you purchase can be considered both a production and a capital good.

For example, if your car is worth $10,000 and you use it 20% of the time for leisure and 80% of the time for work, you should consider that it contributes $2,000 to the value of your consumption goods and $8,000 to the value of your capital goods.

**Example net worth composition decision making process:**

I've seen many examples among my family and friends of hesitancy to rent and a bias toward owning non-monetary goods.

In the fiat standard, this hesitancy originates from our desire to reduce the amount of cash we hold due to its loss of purchasing power over time. The opposite occurs under the Bitcoin standard, where we are more hesitant to take on ownership because owning non-Bitcoin assets results in the opportunity cost of increased Bitcoin purchasing power in the future. Consequently, we are more likely to think carefully about what we want to own, making renting more normalized under the Bitcoin standard.

On a full Bitcoin standard, we want to avoid the habit of rushing into ownership of something that will continue to decline in value in terms of Bitcoin over time. This habit of rushing into ownership stems from the fiat standard, which urged us to get rid of our liquidity, which was losing purchasing power over time, as soon as possible. The full Bitcoin standard reverses this habit, eliminating the need to own something to offset the loss of purchasing power over time.

This is why, on a full Bitcoin standard, we need to know when to own and when to rent to make informed decisions. We must understand the distinction between ownership and possession. When you need to use a product for a set period, you should rent it.

We established a method for calculating and tracking the cost of ownership (depreciation, maintenance). This helps you see if owning something fits with your other budget goals and net worth. Renting something instead of buying it might provide the same benefits without the cost of ownership. Renting means paying the owner for the use of something for a set period.

Renting can be a very effective tool for increasing your net worth because you can get the value of something if you plan your usage over time. By running a zero-based budget regularly, you will better understand the value you can derive over time by using the item without necessarily owning it.

Consider renting items in the "Consumption" and "Capital" categories. A proper framework is to ask, "For how long do I plan to use this item, and for what purpose?" rather than "I want to own this item." There is such a thing as "house fever" or "car fever," where people become fixated on owning a house or car they cannot yet afford and fall into the trap of going into debt to do so. The antidote is to consider renting the same house or car for a period to experience how it feels to use them. Often, this leads to a more rational consideration of the purchase, especially after performing the cost of ownership calculation.

### Non-Monetary Goods Cost Of Ownership

The depreciation rate is the difference between the price of a new item and the price after it has been used, measured over time.

Higher maintenance expenses generally result in a lower depreciation rate.

Lower maintenance expenses generally increase the rate of depreciation.

Cost of insurance: insurance against item destruction or malfunction.

Insurance against theft/extortion (includes your local fiat government taxes).

Consider the last time you paid a higher price for something. Everything you buy, own, and use depreciates over time. For example, when you buy a new phone, unbox it, and start using it, the phone loses some of its value because it is no longer brand new and unboxed - you started using it.

Items have a market-based depreciation curve. Using the same phone as an example, you can figure out how much your phone is worth when it's used after a year.

When you buy something, keep track of its depreciation in your budget. When you buy a phone for $700, you should track it as an asset worth $650 (the $50 difference is due to the fact that it is no longer brand new). After a year of use, for example, you should assess the market price of this item, i.e. how much money you can get if you liquidate it.

Assume that figure is $500; you adjust it in your budget. This is something you keep doing while using the item. You keep doing this while using the item. Remember that using the item frequently results in additional maintenance costs over time. If, after two years of use, your phone's battery loses 30% of its charge, you may choose to replace the battery rather than the phone itself.

Cars, on the other hand, require a once (or better, twice) yearly maintenance schedule to ensure they run reliably and for a longer period of time. You should budget for these ongoing maintenance costs and keep track of the depreciation of your possessions as you go.

### Keep No More than One-Third of Your Net Worth in Production Goods

Capital is defined as all goods not used for consumption but for the production of consumption goods.

In this practical context, we can define capital as all large durable goods (movable or immovable), as well as anything else used to generate cash flow and/or used during working hours (labor).

As an example, consider a merchant's inventory stock. tools for a car mechanic. A programmer's laptop.

Goods may be used as both consumption and capital goods.

For example, if you own a car that you use both for leisure and for work, you should account for its value in both the consumption and capital parts of your net worth.

By definition, capital also includes all financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and investment vehicles such as mutual funds, index funds, and so on.

On a strict Bitcoin standard, consider whether you are using an investment vehicle as money. In today's fiat standard, there are many investment vehicles that are practically monetized, such as automatically rebalanced broad stock indexes like SP500 index fund. If you use any of these, consider upgrading their monetary use to Bitcoin.

### Keep at Least One-Third of Your Net Worth in Bitcoin

Cash is the most liquid and salable component of your net worth.

Use Bitcoin for this, ideally, and convert it to fiat when you have obligations denominated in fiat.

Cash (Bitcoin) should be the majority of your net worth, at least one-third, preferably more.
