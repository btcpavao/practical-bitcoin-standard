# Managing Future Bitcoin Price Expectations & Handling Volatility

* purpose of this guide: learn to react and take advantage to Bitcoin volatility, instead of trying to hedge against it
* can we predict future price? just like with weather in the future, we can't predict it 100% exactly, but we can have reasonable expectations with varying degrees of confidence
* nocoiners look at bitcoin price chart in linear scale, both for time and price
* most bitcoiners realize it's better to look at bitcoin price in log scale
* when you look at the chart from log scale for price and in log scale for time, you notice a pattern: bitcoin grows according to power law
* patterns and cycles
* market sentiment estimation: fear & greed
* sideways price movement
* as long as we can see people getting into Bitcoin while having debt on their balance sheets, expect higher volatility
* what should you do when you feel bearish?
* what should you do when you feel bullish?
* focus on price & time
* power law theory - explanation
* ultimately, go back to your budget & use power law theory just to get a sense where we are
* don't worry too much about timing the market, focus on spending time in the market
* zoom out, start looking at time in log scale
* understand Bitcoin monetization will take a century
* if you use Bitcoin as your primary money, all of this will be very easy
* think in terms of quantity and quality of your time - bitcoin fluctuations should mean increasing or decreasing quantity and quality of your time: "I have 6 months of my current quality of time saved. If I double my quality of time by spending double of what I spend now, I'll have 3 months of my time saved. If bitcoin doubles in price, I'll have 12 months of my current quality of time saved. if bitcoin price gets cut in half, I'll have 3 months of my time saved.
* working means trading your time for money, so you can trade money for higher quantity & quality of time later
* idea of your bank of time that you are trading for more & higher quality of time: 40hours in a week, 160 hours in a month, 1700-1900 hours in a year, 17000 - 19000 hours in a decade
