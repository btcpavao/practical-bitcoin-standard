# Bitcoin Price Expectations Management

* price volatility, is it completely random?
* patterns and cycles
* sentiment estimation: fear & greed
* check if there is leverage in the market
* power law theory
* ultimately, go back to your budget & use models just to get a sense where we are
* don't worry too much about timing the market, focus on spending time in the market
* if you use Bitcoin as your primary money, all of this will be very easy
