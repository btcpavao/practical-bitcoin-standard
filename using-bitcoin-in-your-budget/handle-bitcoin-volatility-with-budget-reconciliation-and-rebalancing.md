# Handle Bitcoin Volatility With Budget Reconciliation & Rebalancing

"But bitcoin is too volatile!" you'll hear someone say. "So, auto-DCA is how you should grow your stack".

Many well-intentioned bitcoiners recommend, particularly to newcomers, that they adopt a “stacking sats” mentality. Ideally, they say, newcomers should set up an automatic “dollar cost averaging” plan by deciding on two fixed elements: the amount they wish to invest (for example, $50) and a recurring time period (say every month). By doing so, you “set it and forget it” and buy bitcoin regularly, on both price increases and decreases, thereby averaging out the fluctuations. This strategy has outperformed all other savings instruments, such as investing in stock indexes, bonds, real estate, and precious metals.

Nonetheless, this strategy has several risks that are rarely discussed, and I’ll list them here.

1. You will experience FOMO in a bull market.

Auto-dca users will likely feel “underinvested” in bitcoin when the true bull market begins (typically some time after the “halvings” due to the new marginal supply being cut in half), and will fear the price will run away from them. This is where auto-dca services typically market their “smash buy” and “boost” features, which are meant to - in a sense - alleviate this FOMO feeling by doubling down or increasing your DCA rate. However, this is short-lived, and it is extremely difficult to resist the temptation to allocate a larger portion of one’s portfolio to bitcoin during a bull run.

Consequently, as a result of the increase in the price of bitcoin, many people are compelled to alter their strategy, and they begin to attempt to time the market to compensate for the opportunity cost of not allocating more during bear market periods.

2. Your inflows and outflows are in flux, but your strategy does not reflect this.

Essentially, if you begin your auto-dca strategy with the intention of putting it on autopilot and “setting it and forgetting it,” you are not taking into account changes to your future inflows and outflows. If your inflows increase, you’ll be tempted to adjust the amount you allocate, and if they decrease, you’ll want to reduce them and/or spread them out over time. Essentially, the only way to truly “set it and forget it” is to set it to a very small number that is evenly distributed across maximum time intervals. If your dollar cost average is only $1 per year, you can likely sustain this for the rest of your life, but the gains will be negligible, despite bitcoin’s volatile and intense path to becoming the dominant money.

Also, a “set it and forget it” mentality is extremely detrimental to your long-term approach to making and spending money. You are in a constant state of change, as are your time preferences, your evaluations of goods and services, and prices. Thus, you should not create artificial mental anchors to essentially comfort your background whisper that you do not have enough bitcoin.

risk 3) you are not receiving the advantages of spending when your purchasing power rises and saving when it falls.
