# Bitcoin Standard Incentivizes Net Income Growth

* Fiat standard incentivizes us to keep net income negative. We want to spend more than we earn in the present, and get into longer and longer debt duration, so that we have negative balance. This way we are effectively shorting fiat, because we are paying of nominal debt amount with debased money.
* Bitcoin standard incentivizes us to grow net income (inflows minus outflows) over time and accumulate cash position that way. This is because over time, our cash (savings) will keep appreciating in purchasing power.
* 4 ways to increase net income
  * **decrease outflow rate, keep inflow rate the same**. example: you make $100k/year and you spend $90k/year. you keep making $100k/year but you reduce your spending by $10k/year, from $90k/year to $80k/year. by doing this your net income went from $10k/year to $20k/year
  * **increase inflow rate, keep outflow rate the same**. example: you make $100k/year and you spend $90k/year. you keep spending at $90k/year but you increase your inflows by $10k/year from $100k/year to $110k/year. by doing this your net income went from $10k/year to $20k/year.
  * **increase inflow rate, decrease outflow rate**. example: you make $100k/year and you spend $90k/year. you reduce spending by $5k/year from $90k/year to $85k/year. uou also increase your inflows by $5k/year from $100k/year to $105k/year. by doing this your net income went from $10k/year to $20k/year.
  * **increase both inflow and outflow rate, but increase inflow rate more than outflow rate**. example: you make $100k/year and you spend $90k/year. you increase spending by $10k from $90k/year to $100k/year and you increase your inflows by $20k from $100k/year to $120k/year. by doing this your net income went from $10k/year to $20k/year
* don't bother about nominal amount of Bitcoin you have, think in terms of purchasing power and changes in net income. if you do this right, your net income will keep growing over time, and as your Bitcoin savings grow, it's purchasing power appreciation will add on to net income growth by increasing your overall inflow rate (from reconciling your purchasing power).
