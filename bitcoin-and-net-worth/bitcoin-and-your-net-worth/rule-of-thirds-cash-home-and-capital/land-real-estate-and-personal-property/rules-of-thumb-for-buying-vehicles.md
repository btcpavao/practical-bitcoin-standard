# Ownership Of Large Durable Goods

First and foremost, do not exceed the rule of thirds. Large durable goods are part of your net worth's Land and/or Capital segments. Before purchasing, calculate the total cost of ownership. After purchasing, update the value of the land and/or capital on a regular basis to keep track of the depreciation rate.

The market value of all vehicles you own (cars, motorcycles, boats, or anything with a motor inside) should not exceed six months of your average inflows.

For example, if you earn $100,000 per year, you should not have more than $50,000 in total vehicle ownership. This is all presuming you compute the cost of ownership beforehand and pay cash for them.

When deciding whether to buy new or used, consider the cost of ownership calculation, as well as the depreciation rate for the vehicle you are considering.

Remember the rule of thirds: allocate no more than one-third of your net worth in Land and no more than one-third in Capital. People typically use vehicles as both a consumable good (part of Land) and Capital (they drive to work with it or directly use it to generate inflows), so the vehicle you purchase can be considered both Land and Capital.

For example, if your car is worth $10,000 and you use it 20% of the time ffor leisure and 80% of the time for work, you should consider that it contributes $2,000 to the value of your Land and $8,000 to the value of your Capital.
