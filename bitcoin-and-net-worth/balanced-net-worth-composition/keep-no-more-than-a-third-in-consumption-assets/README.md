# Keep No More Than A Third In Consumption Assets

Ownership of consumption assets in the context of this manual includes ownership of the actual land, real estate (buildings) on it, and all large durable goods on it (furniture, household appliances, art, electronics, vehicles, and so on).

We define consumption assets in this context by their function - we use them for our leisure (non-labor) time. We can also think of consumption assets as a collection of all of our goods (more or less durable, movable or immovable) we consume. We track the value of consumption assets if each of them represents more than 1/60 of total net worth value.

For example, we can have a house with all the furniture/appliances (approximately $190k) and a car (approximately $10k) that we only use for leisure, both of which are worth approximately $200k. This means that the land is worth around $200,000.

However, if we use the same house and car for labor, the total value of the land is less than $200k. If we use a home office that is equipped with furniture/appliances used solely for work and is around 30% of the market price of the house, and we use the car around 50% of the time to do our work, we should account the value of our land at $133k (70%) for a house and $5k (50%) for a car, for a total of $138k.
