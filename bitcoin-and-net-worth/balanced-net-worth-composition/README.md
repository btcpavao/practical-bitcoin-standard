# Balanced Net Worth Composition

The main point is to always have enough cash on hand in your net worth so that you can grow it in the best way possible. If you adopt a full Bitcoin standard, Bitcoin is going to be a part of your cash balance, so you will practice zero-based budgeting with it.&#x20;

The best way to grow net worth overall is to follow the rule of thirds, and make sure that no more than a third of our assets are in Land and no more than a third are in Capital.

Increase in cash (Bitcoin) purchasing power -> opportunity to increase Land & Capital (up to, but no more than, one-third of net worth in each).

Period of decreasing cash (Bitcoin) purchasing power -> opportunity for decreasing Land & Capital (if they exceed a third of net worth in each) by liquidating a portion back to cash (Bitcoin).

The goal of balancing is to always have at least one-third in cash (Bitcoin) to maximize the Giving portion of the budget (we are only budgeting cash, not illiquid assets).

For example, a $1 million net worth with only 5% cash (Bitcoin) will have only 0.5% - 1% ($5,000 to $10,000) in the Giving portion of a budget. The same $1 million net worth that has at least 33,3% in cash (Bitcoin) will have at least 3,3% to 6,7% ($33k to $66k) in the Giving category. The same net worth of 80% cash (Bitcoin) will have 8% to 16% ($80k to $160k) in Giving category. The last one will grow at the fastest rate due to the fastest rate of growth of the spirit of generosity.

You should always keep track of the items you own and their current market prices. This is especially important for more expensive items like real estate and vehicles, but it's also very useful to do it for less expensive items you own.

Your total net worth is the sum of the current market prices of all the assets you own, minus all your liabilities (debts). We've already established that the first step you should take is to run a zero-based budget, the second is to eliminate all debt, and the third is to establish a giving practice from your liquid budget. So at this point, your net worth should have zero debts.

The goal of balancing the structure of your net worth is to ensure that its growth remains at its optimal pace over time. Achieving this may sometimes require liquidating (selling) part of your Capital or Land assets, and moving that into Cash. At other times, it might mean buying Capital or Land, but only up to a value of one-third of your total net worth for each.

Your net worth composition will also change with changes in Bitcoin purchasing power.
