# Bitcoin Standard Incentivizes Net Income Growth

The Fiat standard encourages us to keep our net income negative. We want to spend more money than we bring in right now and accumulate debt over time to get a negative fiat balance. Because we are paying off nominal debt with debased money, we are effectively shorting fiat. Unfortunately, while this approach works for some, it comes at the cost of generating negative spirits (slavery, restlesness and confusion). Because of this, the majority of people who, by Fiat standard, are considered to have high net worth nevertheless bear the burden of perpetual debt.

The Bitcoin standard incentivizes us to accumulate cash position by growing net income (inflows minus outflows) over time. This is because our cash (savings) will increase in purchasing power over time.

There are 5 ways to increase your net income.

**Reduce the outflow rate while maintaining the inflow rate constant.** Assume you earn $100,000 per year and spend $90,000. You keep earning $100k per year but reduce your spending by $10k per year, from $90k to $80k. Your net income increased from $10,000 to $20,000.

**Increase the inflow rate while maintaining the outflow rate constant.** Assume you earn $100,000 per year and spend $90,000. You maintain your spending at $90k per year while increasing your inflows from $100k to $110k per year. This increased your net income from $10,000 to $20,000.

**Increase the inflow rate and decrease the outflow rate.** Assume you earn $100,000 per year and spend $90,000. You reduce your annual spending by $5,000, from $90,000 to $85,000. You also increase your annual inflows by $5k, from $100k to $105k. This increased your net income from $10,000 to $20,000**.**

**Increase both the inflow and outflow rates, but increase the inflow rate more than the outflow rate.** Assume you earn $100,000 per year and spend $90,000. You increase your spending by $10k from $90k to $100k per year and your inflows by $20k from $100k to $120k per year. Your net income increased from $10,000 to $20,000.

**Decrease both the inflow and outflow rates, but decrease the outflow rate more than the inflow rate.** Assume you earn $100,000 per year and spend $90,000. You reduce your spending by $20,000 per year, from $90,000 to $70,000 per year. You also reduce your annual inflows by $10,000, from $100,000 to $90,000. This increased your net income from $10,000 to $20,000.

Don't be concerned with the nominal amount of Bitcoin you own; instead, consider changes in purchasing power and net income. If you do this correctly, your net income will increase over time. And, as your Bitcoin savings grow, their purchasing power appreciation will contribute to net income growth by increasing your overall inflow rate (due to purchasing power reconciliation).

For example, if you earn $60k per year and spend $50k per year, it makes no difference whether the Bitcoin exchange rate is $30k/BTC or $60k/BTC in terms of your net income and purchasing power. An increase in the value of Bitcoin means that your savings purchasing power has increased, but not necessarily your net income. Similarly, a decline in the purchasing power of Bitcoin does not always translate into a decline in your net income. In fact, when Bitcoin's purchasing power falls, you'll be incentivized to increase your net income.&#x20;

You will certainly increase your net income if you follow the principles outlined in the first section of the guide (keep a zero-based budget, stay debt-free, and set aside 10-20% of your budget for giving) and make sure your net worth composition is balanced (keep at least a third in Bitcoin, and no more than a third in Land and Capital, each).
