# Keep No More Than A Third Of Your Net Worth In Consumption Goods

Ownership of consumption assets in the context of this manual includes ownership of the actual land, real estate (buildings) on it, and all large durable goods on it (furniture, household appliances, art, electronics, vehicles, and so on).

We define consumption assets in this context by their function - we use them for our leisure (non-labor) time. We can also think of consumption assets as a collection of all of our goods (more or less durable, movable or immovable) we consume. We track the value of consumption assets if each of them represents more than 1/60 of total net worth value.

For example, we can have a house with all the furniture/appliances (approximately $190k) and a car (approximately $10k) that we only use for leisure, both of which are worth approximately $200k. This means that the land is worth around $200,000.

However, if we use the same house and car for labor, the total value of the land is less than $200k. If we use a home office that is equipped with furniture/appliances used solely for work and is around 30% of the market price of the house, and we use the car around 50% of the time to do our work, we should account the value of our land at $133k (70%) for a house and $5k (50%) for a car, for a total of $138k.

### Non-Monetary Goods Ownership Tracking

First and foremost, do not exceed the rule of thirds. Large durable goods are part of your net worth's Land and/or Capital segments. Before purchasing, calculate the total cost of ownership. After purchasing, update the value of the land and/or capital on a regular basis to keep track of the depreciation rate.

The market value of all vehicles you own (cars, motorcycles, boats, or anything with a motor inside) should not exceed six months of your average inflows.

For example, if you earn $100,000 per year, you should not have more than $50,000 in total vehicle ownership. This is all presuming you compute the cost of ownership beforehand and pay cash for them.

When deciding whether to buy new or used, consider the cost of ownership calculation, as well as the depreciation rate for the vehicle you are considering.

Remember the rule of thirds: allocate no more than one-third of your net worth in Land and no more than one-third in Capital. People typically use vehicles as both a consumable good (part of Land) and Capital (they drive to work with it or directly use it to generate inflows), so the vehicle you purchase can be considered both Land and Capital.

For example, if your car is worth $10,000 and you use it 20% of the time ffor leisure and 80% of the time for work, you should consider that it contributes $2,000 to the value of your Land and $8,000 to the value of your Capital.

### Renting Vs Owning Non-Monetary Goods

* I've seen many examples in my family and friends of the hesitancy to rent, and a bias for ownership of non-monetary goods
* this stems from the natural inclination in the fiat standard, to minimize the amount of cash we hold over time, since it's a melting ice cube
* the opposite happens on the Bitcoin standard. we are more hesitant to enter into ownership, since owning non-Bitcoin assets will inevitably incur the opportunity cost of increased purchasing power of Bitcoin in the future. thus, we are inclined to be much more deliberate on what we want to own. this is why renting is likely to become more normalized on the Bitcoin standard

On a full Bitcoin standard, we want to avoid the habit of rushing into ownership of something that will continue to decline in value in terms of bitcoin over time.

The habit of rushing into ownership stems from the fiat standard, which urged us to get rid of our liquidity, which was losing purchasing power over time, as soon as possible.

The full Bitcoin standard reverses this habit, and we no longer need to own something to fully or partially offset the loss of purchasing power over time.

This is why, on a full Bitcoin standard, we want to know when to own and when to rent, so we can make informed decisions.

We want to understand the distinction between ownership and possession. When you need to use a product for a set period of time, you should rent it.

We established a method for calculating and tracking the cost of ownership (depreciation, maintenance).&#x20;

This will help you see if owning something fits in with your other budget goals and net worth. If you rent something instead of buying it, you might get the same benefits without having to pay the cost of ownership.&#x20;

Renting means paying the owner for the use of something for a set period of time.&#x20;

Renting can be a very effective tool for increasing your net worth because you can get the value of something if you plan your usage over time. If you run a zero-based budget on a regular basis, you will gain a better understanding of the type of value you can derive over time by using the thing without necessarily owning it.&#x20;

Consider renting items in the "Land" and "Capital" categories.

Proper framework: "For how long do I plan to use this item, and for what purpose?" rather than "I want to own this item."&#x20;

There is such a thing as "house fever" or "car fever," a condition in which people become fixated on the idea of owning a house or a car they cannot afford (yet), and fall into the trap of going into debt to do so.&#x20;

The antidote to this is to consider renting the same house or car for a period of time so you can experience how it feels to use them, and very often you will return to rational consideration of the same house or car, especially after you perform the cost of ownership calculation.

### Non-Monetary Goods Cost Of Ownership

The depreciation rate is the difference between the price of a new item and the price after it has been used, measured over time.

Higher maintenance expenses generally result in a lower depreciation rate.

Lower maintenance expenses generally increase the rate of depreciation.

Cost of insurance: insurance against item destruction or malfunction.

Insurance against theft/extortion (includes your local fiat government taxes).

Consider the last time you paid a higher price for something. Everything you buy, own, and use depreciates over time. For example, when you buy a new phone, unbox it, and start using it, the phone loses some of its value because it is no longer brand new and unboxed - you started using it.

Items have a market-based depreciation curve. Using the same phone as an example, you can figure out how much your phone is worth when it's used after a year.

When you buy something, keep track of its depreciation in your budget. When you buy a phone for $700, you should track it as an asset worth $650 (the $50 difference is due to the fact that it is no longer brand new). After a year of use, for example, you should assess the market price of this item, i.e. how much money you can get if you liquidate it.

Assume that figure is $500; you adjust it in your budget. This is something you keep doing while using the item. You keep doing this while using the item. Remember that using the item frequently results in additional maintenance costs over time. If, after two years of use, your phone's battery loses 30% of its charge, you may choose to replace the battery rather than the phone itself.

Cars, on the other hand, require a once (or better, twice) yearly maintenance schedule to ensure they run reliably and for a longer period of time. You should budget for these ongoing maintenance costs and keep track of the depreciation of your possessions as you go.
