# Renting Vs Owning Non-Monetary Goods

* I've seen many examples in my family and friends of the hesitancy to rent, and a bias for ownership of non-monetary goods
* this stems from the natural inclination in the fiat standard, to minimize the amount of cash we hold over time, since it's a melting ice cube
* the opposite happens on the Bitcoin standard. we are more hesitant to enter into ownership, since owning non-Bitcoin assets will inevitably incur the opportunity cost of increased purchasing power of Bitcoin in the future. thus, we are inclined to be much more deliberate on what we want to own. this is why renting is likely to become more normalized on the Bitcoin standard

On a full Bitcoin standard, we want to avoid the habit of rushing into ownership of something that will continue to decline in value in terms of bitcoin over time.

The habit of rushing into ownership stems from the fiat standard, which urged us to get rid of our liquidity, which was losing purchasing power over time, as soon as possible.

The full Bitcoin standard reverses this habit, and we no longer need to own something to fully or partially offset the loss of purchasing power over time.

This is why, on a full Bitcoin standard, we want to know when to own and when to rent, so we can make informed decisions.

We want to understand the distinction between ownership and possession. When you need to use a product for a set period of time, you should rent it.

We established a method for calculating and tracking the cost of ownership (depreciation, maintenance).&#x20;

This will help you see if owning something fits in with your other budget goals and net worth. If you rent something instead of buying it, you might get the same benefits without having to pay the cost of ownership.&#x20;

Renting means paying the owner for the use of something for a set period of time.&#x20;

Renting can be a very effective tool for increasing your net worth because you can get the value of something if you plan your usage over time. If you run a zero-based budget on a regular basis, you will gain a better understanding of the type of value you can derive over time by using the thing without necessarily owning it.&#x20;

Consider renting items in the "Land" and "Capital" categories.

Proper framework: "For how long do I plan to use this item, and for what purpose?" rather than "I want to own this item."&#x20;

There is such a thing as "house fever" or "car fever," a condition in which people become fixated on the idea of owning a house or a car they cannot afford (yet), and fall into the trap of going into debt to do so.&#x20;

The antidote to this is to consider renting the same house or car for a period of time so you can experience how it feels to use them, and very often you will return to rational consideration of the same house or car, especially after you perform the cost of ownership calculation.
