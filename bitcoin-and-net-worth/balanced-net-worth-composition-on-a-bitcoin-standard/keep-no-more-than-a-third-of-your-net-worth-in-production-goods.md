# Keep No More Than A Third In Production Assets

Capital is defined as all goods not used for consumption but for the production of consumption goods.

In this practical context, we define Capital as all large durable goods (movable or immovable), as well as anything else used to generate cash flow and/or used during working hours (labor).

As an example, consider a merchant's inventory stock. tools for a car mechanic. A programmer's laptop.

Goods may be used as both consumption and capital goods.

For example, if you own a car that you use both for leisure and for work, you should account for its value in both the Land and Capital parts of your net worth.

By definition, Capital also includes all financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and investment vehicles such as mutual funds, index funds, and so on.

On a strict Bitcoin standard, consider whether you are using an investment vehicle as money. In today's fiat standard, there are many investment vehicles that are practically monetized, such as automatically rebalanced broad stock indexes like SP500 index fund. If you use any of these, consider upgrading their monetary use to Bitcoin.
