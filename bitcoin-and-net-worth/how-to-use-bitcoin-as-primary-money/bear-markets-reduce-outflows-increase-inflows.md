# When Bitcoin Purchasing Power Drops Reduce Your Outflows And Increase Your Inflows

Assume that your bitcoin purchasing power will decline by 10% per month for the next eight months. Consider knowing this was going to happen. You'd be smart to sell bitcoin for fiat and then buy it back later for a bargain, wouldn't you? Right?

Not at all.

Because two things will inevitably happen if you stick with your declining purchasing power savings vehicleâ€”bitcoin.

You will first seek ways to reduce and optimize your outflows. You will reduce unnecessary spending. You will learn how to make bulk purchases. You'll think about the time value of money more. You'll understand what duration risk is and how it works. You'll discover previously unknown ways to save money. In general, you will save energy to achieve the same, or possibly better, output. Staying in this mindset will provide valuable lessons for the future. It will encourage you to cultivate gratitude and contentment, which will gradually permeate your entire being.

Second, you'll look for ways to increase your inflows. If you have an employer, you will begin to change your attitude toward them. You'll quickly realize that you shouldn't refer to him as your boss or employer. He is, in fact, your client. He's buying your most valuable resource: your time. And when you sell your time to a client, you want to give them the best service possible. You'll also realize that you may be working with multiple clients. You'll start organizing your time, which is the asset you're selling. How much of this asset do you own? Next week, can you sell 36 hours of uninterrupted time? Can you plan out 30 hours of very high quality flow state time for the next five days on Sunday? Be thankful for your clients. Be grateful that you can meet the needs and desires of others by selling your time. This is God's work. God rewards your service to his children by blessing you with higher inflows.

Staying in this mindset during the bear market will provide valuable lessons for the future. It will encourage you to cultivate gratitude and contentment, which will gradually permeate your entire being. When 2022 bitcoin bear market started, I adopted the practice of writing down 3 things I'm grateful, six days a week. By the end of the year, I've written over 300 things I'm grateful for, which slowly but surely grew my optimism about the future. And when you have spirit of optimism - people like to work with you. And this inevitably leads to increased inflows.
