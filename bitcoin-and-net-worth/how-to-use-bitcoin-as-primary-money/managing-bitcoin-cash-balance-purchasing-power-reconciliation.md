# How To Reconcile Changes In Bitcoin's Purchasing Power

We're accustomed to using fiat money as our cash balance, whether it's physical cash in our wallets or money in our checking and immediately available savings accounts. Most bitcoiners view Bitcoin as their "investment," "retirement fund," or "long-term savings" and treat it as an illiquid asset on their balance sheet.

If you've successfully implemented the previous three steps as a rock-solid foundation (running a zero-based budget for at least 180 days, eliminating all debt from your balance sheet, and establishing a regular giving practice with 10% to 20% of your budget), you should strongly consider treating Bitcoin as part of your cash balance and transitioning to the full Bitcoin standard.

When you begin using Bitcoin as part of your cash balance, you'll need to introduce one more practice into your zero-based budgeting: purchasing power reconciliation. How does this work?

Let's say you currently hold $10,000 worth of Bitcoin, which you use as your cash balance, and you don't have any other forms of money at the moment. This $10,000 in Bitcoin is all you have. Consequently, you'll allocate $10,000 to your budget categories until there's nothing left to assign.

Let's use our example of $10,000:

Total Budget: $10,000

Giving: $2,000

Shelter: $2,000

Groceries: $2,000

Transport: $2,000

Everything Else: $2,000

However, what should you do if the Bitcoin exchange rate suddenly drops by 20% in a day? If your Bitcoin is suddenly worth $8,000, you need to adjust your budget categories because your budget currently has $2,000 assigned more than you actually possess.

To balance the budget, subtract $2,000 in total from your categories, which is $400 from each:

Total Budget: $10,000 -> $8,000

Giving: $2,000 -> $1,600

Shelter: $2,000 -> $1,600

Groceries: $2,000 -> $1,600

Transport: $2,000 -> $1,600

Everything Else: $2,000 -> $1,600

Now, our budget is back in balance.

What should we do if the Bitcoin exchange rate increases by 20% in a day? We perform budget reconciliation once again. Initially, we assigned $10,000 in our budget, but now we have $12,000 in the budget, meaning you have an extra $2,000 to allocate. To balance the budget, add an extra $400 to each category:

Total Budget: $10,000 -> $12,000

Giving: $2,000 -> $2,400

Shelter: $2,000 -> $2,400

Groceries: $2,000 -> $2,400

Transport: $2,000 -> $2,400

Everything Else: $2,000 -> $2,400

Once again, your budget is back in balance, with no unassigned money.

How often should you perform this reconciliation? It's up to you, but I recommend doing it frequently, especially when the change is more than a few percent in either direction. Each time you reconcile the budget this way, you have the opportunity to fine-tune the assigned amounts in different categories.

## Why Do This?

"Bitcoin is too volatile!" you'll often hear. "Just dollar cost average and don't touch your stack."

Many well-intentioned Bitcoiners recommend, especially to newcomers, adopting a "stacking sats" approach. Ideally, they suggest that newcomers set up (ideally an automatic) "dollar-cost averaging" (DCA) plan by deciding on two fixed elements: the amount they wish to invest (for example, $50) and a recurring time period (say, every month).&#x20;

By doing so, you can "set it and forget it," you are buying Bitcoin regularly, whether the price is increasing or decreasing, thus averaging out the fluctuations. This strategy has indeed outperformed doing the same into other popular savings instruments like investing in stock indexes, bonds, real estate, and precious metals.

Nonetheless, this strategy has several risks that are rarely discussed, and I'll list them here:

**1. You will experience feeling of greed (FOMO, fear of missing out) in a bull market.**&#x20;

When the true Bitcoin bull market begins, typically some time after the "halvings" due to the new marginal supply being cut in half, it's very likely auto-DCA bitcoiners will feel "underinvested" in Bitcoin. Whatever the amount of fiat they still have, they will start to fear that the Bitcoin price will run away from them.&#x20;

This is where auto-DCA services will typically market them their "smash buy" and "boost" features, which are meant to alleviate this FOMO feeling by doubling down or increasing their DCA rate. However, this can quickly lead to unwise decisions, because it is extremely difficult to resist the temptation to allocate a larger portion of one's portfolio to Bitcoin during a bull run.

Consequently, many people are compelled to let go of their auto-DCA strategy at some point and begin to attempt to time the market to compensate for the opportunity cost of not allocating more during bear market period.

This behavior is precisely the opposite of what you should be doing during a bull market. You should be focusing on planning for your future outflows and utilizing the appreciation of your Bitcoin savings, even if you feel underinvested in Bitcoin, to cover them. Essentially, during a bull market, your time should be spent using your past budgeting data to better plan for the future, rather than trying to earn more money at your job and studying Bitcoin price action to make up for the opportunity cost incurred during the bear market.

**2. Your inflows and outflows are in flux, but your strategy does not reflect this.**&#x20;

Essentially, if you begin your auto-DCA strategy with the intention of putting it on autopilot and "setting it and forgetting it," you are not taking into account changes to your future inflows and outflows.&#x20;

If your inflows increase, you'll be tempted to adjust the amount you allocate, and if they decrease, you'll want to reduce them and/or spread them out over time. Essentially, the only way to truly "set it and forget it" is to set it to a very small number that is evenly distributed across maximum time intervals. If your dollar cost average is only $1 per year, you can likely sustain this for the rest of your life, but the gains will be negligible, despite Bitcoin's volatile and intense path to becoming the dominant form of money.&#x20;

Also, a "set it and forget it" mentality is detrimental to your long-term approach to learning how to properly manage your money. You are in a constant state of change, as is your time preference and your valuation of different goods and services.
