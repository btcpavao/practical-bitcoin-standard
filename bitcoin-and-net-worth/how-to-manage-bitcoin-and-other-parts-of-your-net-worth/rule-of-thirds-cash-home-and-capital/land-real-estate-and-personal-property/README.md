# Land (Real Estate & Personal Property)

Ownership of Land in the context of this manual includes ownership of the actual land, real estate (buildings) on it, and all large durable goods on it (furniture, household appliances, art, electronics, vehicles, and so on).

We define Land in this context by its function - we use it for our leisure (non-labor) time. We can also think of Land as a collection of all of our larger durable (movable or immovable) consumption goods. A good rule of thumb is that if you own something worth more than 1/60 of your total net worth and use it as a consumption good, i.e. in your leisure time, it is part of your net worth's "Land" component.

Land can be held in several physical locations or in just one. For example, your primary residence and two vehicles may be located in one location, while your secondary residence, a vacation residence, and another vehicle may be located in a different location. The entire market value of both is considered to be part of the Land.

For example, we can have a house with all the furniture/appliances (approximately $190k) and a car (approximately $10k) that we only use for leisure, both of which are worth approximately $200k. This means that the land is worth around $200,000.

However, if we use the same house and car for labor, the total value of the land is less than $200k. If we use a home office that is equipped with furniture/appliances used solely for work and is around 30% of the market price of the house, and we use the car around 50% of the time to do our work, we should account the value of our land at $133k (70%) for a house and $5k (50%) for a car, for a total of $138k.
