# How to give?

* smaller but more often is better then larger less often
* family first, friends second, acquintances third, local community fourth etc.
* if the giving is charity driven, the best way is for the beneficiary not to know that you are benefactor
* if you want to help someone financially, the best way to do so is to invest in their business (no expectations of return), so they retain their dignity
* there is no giving goal here, it's a lifetime journey and practice you should continue doing without stopping
