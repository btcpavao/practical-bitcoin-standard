# Giving Money Benefits Giver More Than Recipient

* I'm recommending separating 10% to 20% of your cash in your budget and assigning it to Giving category
* I'm recommending this with 100% focus on what it will do to your psychospiritual makeup, and it is that it will cultivate spirit of generosity
* spirit of generosity will increase your inflows (I'll explain how and why later). for now, just think about this budget category as a way of increasing your inflows
