# Rule Of Thirds: Cash, Home & Capital

* think of your net worth having optimal balance of three different segments, in which, if they are in correct size compared to each other, total net worth is going to grow in the fastest and most sustainable & enjoyable way
* the first part of your net worth is the most liquid part that has least diminishing returns in marginal utility - your cash
* cash balance can comprise most of your net worth, and even if it is more than a third - it is not going to hamper your ability to grow it
* however, two second parts: the value of your home and the value of your capital stock: if they are outsized compared to your total net worth - this can hamper your ability to grow it
* example: $500k net worth, out of which 90% is home ($450k), and the rest is investment (say $40k in something like balanced portfolio of bonds & stocks) and finally, $10k in cash. this net worth balance is heavily skewed towards home, and will present serious detriment on it's growth. an optimal net worth distribution in this case would be: up to $165k in home, up to $165k in investments, and the rest in cash
