# Assessing Your Net Worth & Balancing It

* you should always keep track of items you own, and their current market price. this is especially true for more expensive items, like real estate & vehicles, but is also very useful to do it for less expensive items you own.
* your total net worth is a sum of the current market price of all of the assets you own, minus all liabilites you have (debts). we already established that the first step you should take is to run a zero based budget, second is to eliminate all debt, and third is to establish giving practice from your liquid budget
* the goal of balancing net worth is to make sure your net worth growth remains at its optimal pace over time, and doing so can sometimes mean liquidating (selling) part of your capital or land assets. sometimes it will mean buying capital or land assets, but only up to a value of one third of total net worth per each.
