# Renting Things

* we established how to calculate and track ownership (depreciation, maintenance)
* if you do this, you will often realize that ownership doesn't fit with your other budget goals and net worth balance. however, you will likely derive benefit of the same thing without incurring the cost of ownership if you consider renting it
* renting is paying the owner for the usage of thing, for a certain amount of time
* Renting can be a very powerful tool for increasing your net worth because you can get the value of the usage of something if your usage can be planned over time.
* if you run zero based budget consistently, you will get better idea on the type of value you can derive across time by using the thing, without neccesary owning it
* renting items for leisure
* renting capital goods
* correct framework: "For how long do I plan to use this item, and for what purpose?" instead of "I want to own this item." there is such a thing as "house fever" or "car fever", a situation in which people get stuck on the idea of wanting to own the house or the car they can't afford (yet), and falling into a trap of getting into debt to do so. the antidote for this is to consider the idea of renting the same house or car for a certain period of time, so you can experience how it feels to use them, and very often you will come back to rational consideration of the same house or car, especially after you perform the cost of ownership
